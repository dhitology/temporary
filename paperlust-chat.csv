"Hello  
We are considering changing the date our our wedding in light of COVID 19. We have already paid for our invitations but the printing process hasn't started. what options do we have available to hold on the design finalisation and printing process until we make a decision?

thanks 
Adelaide"
you too
Fantastic. We will go ahead with that then
How long would be be able to hold the process for?
no thank you
Hi  i would like to create a custom wedding invitation design and i will only need the soft file - without the printed copies. Is it possible?
Noted  thank you very much for your help
thank you
that's all for now
you too!
HI. Do you sell stamps (to put on envelope for mailing the wedding invitations) ?
no that was all for now  thanks
okay  thank you
you too.
"Hi  

We currently have a saved design that we are wanting to purchase. However  we are wondering about the spacing. A center line within the middle of the invitation is not movable. This then makes the bottom of our invitation evenly spaced. Is this something that would be fixed before printing?"
unevenly spaced*
Amazing  thank you for your help!
so we will have another proof after we check out?
Ok  thank you! To be clear  we just need all the correct text and then the spacing can be corrected AFTER check out?
So the top half will be pushed further up?
Hi.. I had messaged you yesterday regarding working with paperless. Could you please help me with your email id where I can send my portfolio..thanks
Hi  Im Aishwarya  currently based in Sydney. I was keen to know if you're organisation needs any graphic designer. I am very passionate about designing invitation cards which was what got me excited to write to you. In case if you think I can be of help to you I would  be thrilled to hear back from you.
No  that was it. Thankyou :)
Okay  Thankyou so much
No that was it :)
I lost the chat
Thanks a lot :)
You too :)
When I'm trying to edit the messages for the RSVP card  they don't show up at the preview.
I mean I just want to change the date  that's all :) I'm ordering for my wedding
yes maam
hmm...

Alana."
"Hello  

I have just received a phonecall from another Alana who has accidentally received my wedding invitations. She has stated that she has contacted you and I just  wanted to clarify that my invitations are now on the way to the correct address as I wanted to send them out ASAP. 
Thanks."
No worries
As I said I'm at work so I dont know if I've received them
Sorry I am at work and not able to answer the phone
We only received the save the dates (That aren't for us)
No worries. I will be available after 5.30pm SA time :)

"Hi  
I just wanted to confirm if the Rosey engagement invitations come with a magnet on the back?"
sorry to be fussy
Thank you  I still have to finalize it and move some words around but once I do I'll send through the details. Thank you.
thanks
and then they will send the proof back to me?
Ok  got it  thanks.
INV-723711015
thanks
Should i just be proofing for spelling or layout aswell?
Please change the font of the date to be the same a previous invite but centred (in bold and smaller)
I was wondering whether if i was to design an invite  i would be able to just order one to see how it turns out
if i submit now
hi indra
Hi there!
Thanks Indra
hello?
i will wait for the prrof
How long would the trial invite take to deliver?
thanks
Submitted just then.
ok
no thank you :)
also
Hi. I have just placed an order and have assigned 34 / 40 address. We only need 34  invidations. so we purchased 40. will only have 34/40 invitations filled delay starting printing?
would it be possible to have these by Thursday?
Awesome  how do I add them to the order?
thanks
yes please
ok
Can I still opt to have the save the dates express printed?
thanks
all paid up
one more thing..
shall i submit now then and wait for the invoice?
Also  I was hoping to add a phrase below the name of my fiance and I - would this be possible?
"Okay  no worries. 
I'll pass"
no thats great
Okay  thanks for your help
ok great
and also whether i can ask for a different font?
once i have requested my changes do i then select 'submit to print'?
I am just looking at my save the dates which seem really off centre to me compared to the sample one.
and also if i was to order 90  how long that would take for production and delivery?
Thank you. what would the express turn around time be?
ok perefect  when do you think i would receive them by then?
also  just inquiring if there is anyway to pay a fee for express printing?
so i press submit changes and then submit to print?
could you please centre the & between Nick & Alex - it seems slightly too much to the left
Just wondering if my purchase has been sent?
I paid for expedited printing and was assured I would receive the save the dates by tomorrow
Thanks for your help
All good
Perfect
No
Thatâ€™s great ðŸ‘
Hi  I had two design proofs sent to me 17 hours ago - trying to confirm one of them and it seems to have reverted to the first draft version. Can you help please?
Great! Yes please Jamie
Thanks. I happened to take photos of the two versions just now and can send them to you if that helps
Yep that looks correct - plain front with our names and address on back

I just don't want to confirm the wrong version!
Yes that's the one
That's everything! Thanks for your help
Hi  how do i sort by price?
I thought there was a search within a price bracket feature
Customisable text
Something with dark backing and real foil
Sorry im going to a different website. This is just too difficult to search through. Thanks for your help though.
There is 100s to choose from  this makes it too difficult to search for the features i want within my price range
"Hi there  I'm looking at your ""Tropical Love"" wedding invites  in particular the Save the Date  for my upcoming wedding. I'm just wondering what colour envelopes you think pair well with the design. Thanks! Allanah"
Not at the moment but I will be sure to let you know if there is thanks!
Perfect - thank you very much :)
"Hi there  
I placed an order last night for some wedding invitations to match my save the dates. The order ID is INV-168610915. 

I'd like to match the font colour of the wedding invites to the colour of the save the dates. I believe the save the date font colour had a slight blue tinge but there was only a black font option on the wedding invite. Would it be possible to match the colours exactly?Thanks! Allanah"
"Hi there 
I'm in the process of finalising the beautiful Tropical Love design for my wedding invites  and I'm wanting to choose an envelope. I chose the Forrest Green envelope for the Save the Dates  and was looking for a different colour this time. Looking for something a little more formal and wedding-like  thinking a variation of white. Tossing up between premium white  warm white and pearl - do you think pearl would match this invitation or would you go with the white instead? Thanks."
"Hi there 
I received my Save the date invitations today by mail only to find itâ€™s the wrong order inside. They are wedding invitations for a different Alana. My original order was #INV-928210380. I am very disappointed as these invitations are time critical and Iâ€™ve had such a positive and pleasant experience with Paperlust to date. Hoping this can be rectified today. Happy to come to the Richmond office. Have tried calling but went to message bank."
"Hi there  my name is Allanah and I finalised an order last night for some Save the Dates. I emailed Paperlust with an enquiry before they go to print but haven't heard anything yet. Just wanted to check the addresses would be formatted correctly as I made a mistake in the Address Manager when entering them. The order number is #INV-928210380.

Thanks."
Would you be able to send me a photo of the marshmallow envelope? I can't see it on the website. Thank you for the advice :)
Yes that sounds fine. If I could possibly have the invites by tomorrow (unlikely) or even Wednesday that would be great. As I said you guys have been so helpful through the process.
"The name was ""Jacob & Kris"". I was hoping to update the name to ""Jacob & Krystina""  the address is 5 Gumnut Close  Blaxland  NSW  2774."
No just that thanks
Hi Jamie  yes I've received it and sent a reply. All looks correct to me - thanks for your help!
Thanks
thanks! you too :)
Fantastic. Thanks again for all the help  appreciate it!
Yes I will. Thanks so much for your help! It's been really easy dealing with you guys and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product :)
What would you recommend? Do you think the pearl will clash with the invite and the premium would be better?
Yes thatâ€™s the order I received
There was also one further address I received late that I was hoping to add - is it too late?
No nothing else at the moment :)
No all done for today thanks!
thanks Indra :)
Perfect!! Thank you!
"Yes - when I entered them I put them in on the 'street address; line. But I think I was supposed to put them on the 'city' line. Whoops. If they can be formatted like on the website that would be great!"
Thank you! Just to double check - the envelopes are all the same weight?
You too!
Hi just wondering roughly when my order will be ready to pick up this week?
Hi
Ok cool thank you
Hi Iâ€™m just wondering when I will receive a design proof
Can I ask how long it will take to receive the welcome sign I ordered on the 21/02
Hi  Iâ€™m so sorry I just realised on my wedding invitation envelopes thereâ€™s an & symbol for both the address and the return address. Can we please change this to a + symbol so it matches the others. Sorry for the inconvenience. I understand if I need to pay a fee. Thank you
Yes Iâ€™ll do that now
Ok cool
Ok no worries
And upload the guest names for the back of the menu
Thatâ€™s all for now. Thank you
No that was all thank you
You guys nailed it
Thank you
Thank you
Iâ€™m fine with the amount
Thank you
Just received my design proof everything looks great
Ok cool
No that was all. Thank you
Thatâ€™s ok
Once itâ€™s approved will I be sent instructions
Ok I need to order the seating plan as well on the foam board to match. Iâ€™ll need it by the 13th of March. When would be the latest I can order this one
Iâ€™ll send through the guest names and approve them all
I need everything by next Friday
Thank you
Iâ€™m fine with the amount
How do I do that
Thank you
Ok awesome
Ok easy thank you!!!
Just wondering I need to pay an additional amount
Thank you
How do I pay that

"Dear Shab  

You might not remember  but you provided little thank you cards for my sisters wedding in Nov/Dec 2019 (Amanda Siriwardana). She used them as a little recipe card for a spice jar wedding favour she gave everyone with the recipe of my mum's chicken curry. It was a really fun wedding gift and my mum loved doing it so we were looking at doing the same. 

I was just wondering if you would be able to turn around 115 little thank you cards with one side saying ""Thank You  Amila & Jaleesa (with our names in Otella Font)  4.4.2020"" and the otherside having the recipe on it again which I can send you.
Our wedding is on the 4th April 2020 so there isn't heaps of time  but I thought I would check in and see. 

We would love to hear from you. 

Amila and Jaleesa"

Can I contact Stella M regarding making/altering one of her designs?

How to plan a sweet 16th suprise party
Hi! I'm setting up my wedding website on withjoy.com using the White Garden design that matches your stationery. I just attempted to personalize a wedding sign and see that the fonts are extremely limited. Unfortunately  none of the three options matches what I've used (Pinyon Script) on my website. Is there any way the fonts could be customized as well to complete the consistent design of my wedding? Thank you!
Thanks Jamie! That's very helpful.
"I know one of them will be the Pinyon Script (for our names); not totally sure of the other yet"
Oh ok  thanks! Just wanted to sort that out before I went ahead with the design.
Just received my daughters Save Our Date order.  Do you have an option of thicker paper for the Wedding invitation?  Also  the Envelope is NOT the same color white as the Save the Date  or the correct size (envelope is 3/4 inch larger)  will the 5x7 wedding invitation come with a 5x7 envelope and be the same color white?
Ordered the sample pack.  Hopefully it will not take too long to arrive.  Can you tell me how long your 20% offer is valid?
Drouilhet
Yes the SOD took much longer than expected to arrive.
And is the wedding invitation the same.  Looks like it is bought separately and not coordinated
Thank you.
Ok.  Thank you.  Have a Blessed Day!
are you still there?
Please tell me the specifics of the coordinating wedding invitation.  Is there a thicker paper option in a color that is same as the envelope?
"I know my daughter just ordered the ""standard"" for the SOD and envelope .  Just seems to me that the standards should match one another"
When looking at the invitation that coordinates with the SOD we ordered  I am only seeing 1 paper weight option.  Unable to proceed to envelopes without creating an account.  did not want to since my daughter already has account (do not have her information at this time)
"Hello  can your â€œCottonâ€ or â€œDouble thickâ€ papers be cut into a circle (to create a round menu for example)?
Do you have a linen feel paper stock?"
"Hello  can your â€œCottonâ€ or â€œDouble thickâ€ papers be cut into a circle (to create a round menu for example)?
Do you have a linen feel paper stock?"
assuming I would just nominate a size for the cut? Being custom?
Ah so itâ€™s a physical â€œstampâ€ so not advisable to have individual guest names in foil?
are both those paper stocks available with foil print?
Perfect! Thanks will do
Ok  I do have one of your sample packs here (I previously ordered my wedding invites from Paperlust and am now getting ready to start the â€œon the day stationeryâ€). If the linen paper stock can be cut into a circle  would you mind please posting me a sample piece so I can feel it and see the colour?
Ah ok thanks. Well that narrows it down to the two for me! Im
"Hello  

I received a 10% off code when I ordered my save the dates that is good for a week.  I was hoping to order my invitations within that week time period  but I still have not received my save the dates.  I just don't feel comfortable making another order until my original purchase gets here (getting nervous since it was estimated to arrive 5 days ago!)... is there any way to extend the 10% off offer for a few days until I receive my Save the Dates?"
Can you please tell me a bit more about how your special requests work?
Is there any way to modify the fonts of the various designs?  We love the overall feel of the Garden Window design  but the fonts are a bit difficult to work with.  We are experimenting with Luna as well  and we like the font on that (very easy to read and work with)  but wish there could be a pop of color!
Awesome!  Thank you
DHL has not updated the status since April 15 when the package departed from Melbourne
Great.  Thank you so much.
Got it!  Thank you so much
Thank you so much!
Here is the code:  ANGELE-ZR31I
It just makes me nervous that I can't see exactly what this will look like before checkout!
That is all for today! Thank you so much  Indra
When I tracked it a week ago it said estimated deliver of 4/15 and now it says estimated delivery date is unavailable
My one other question would be about getting addresses printed on the invitation envelopes.  We are using the Luna design and would go with the garamond style for the addresses.  But we would like to be a bit more formal with how we address them.  This means the names could get pretty long which doesn't work great with the spacing of this font. Are the designers able to help us with that formatting?
Hello! My fiance and I are interested in the Pastel Patone invitation suite. Our wedding colors are blush and gold. Is it possible to incorporate gold/foil elements into the design?
Excellent! We live in the US. Can you give me a rough estimate of how much shipping would cost?
Can we order a sample of our customized design before we order the full batch or would we only be able to see a digital proof?
Excellent  thank you! Not today  but we will want to order eventually. Thank you for all of your help!
Ok  I think that would work! How do we specify that we want to add to the design?
Hi there
I would like something quite thick and white and a little bit of texture
152.4mm
"It is 6"" x 6"" and there are 2 cards (flat  not folded). One of the cards is the invite and it is double sided. The second card is an invitation to another event. It is single sided"
(We have a black and white photo on our invite)
Yes that is fine! Is 5mm enough to fit into an envelope?
I have the template of my wedding card created in PEDF
I was hoping to have the addresses printed on the envelopes
Any ideas of how I can pick the paper without the samples?
"Are you able to print the 6"" x  6"" size?"
Hello?
Another question:
Ahh good point. I am not crazy about the linen  so thats good
Oh no!
I am in a hurry to have these printed and was looking to pay the $50 fee to expedite the printing.
I am looking to have this printed by Paperlust.
Yes  I would love to see samples. I live in Canada. How long would it take to arrive here?
ok I can get it to be 147mm
No worries
Both cards need to go into one envelope.
sorry PDF
What would you suggest for something that is classic and luxurious?
What type of papers can you print it on?
How thick is the double thick and the cotton?
"Hi  I am looking for a copy of my daughter's wedding invitation as it is her wedding anniversary this weekend and my son in law has asked me do I have a word copy or a pdf copy.  He must be using it for a card or something.

Thank you
Great.  It worked.  Thanks so much
Could you attempt to email to me at annemaree.hawkings@syd.catholic.edu.au

Hello
"Hi there  
If i were to finalise invitations by today how when would I receive them?"
priority printing?
"Got ya  

so the 10-12 working days dont include weekends"
"Thanks Indra  
I really appreciate the information :) 
I am still abit worried because i need something within  7 days"
Hi Carissa. I picked the 'King Protea' theme from 'withjoy.com' to match our site. I assumed when I clicked to the invite style in to paperlust  that it would automatically add all the details on the back of the invite  so our guests can get the preview links to the joy app  but it hasn't.
Sorry for the questions- ive just had an emergency situation where my graphic designer hasnt supplied me with the art work
No you've covered it all for me.
so it could be 3 weeks?
Thanks.
Thanks so much.
Ah right. I'll need to go in to joy then and see what details I need to add!
How long is design approval? once i have purchased the invites?
03-Apr-20
I am based in melbourne.
i just noticed on your website. 10-12 days for letterpress +foil
so im very stressed for time.
I'll have a look at my options tonight and make a decision then! thank you so much
"Thats convenient- so that would save time waiting for the invites in the post.
Is there anyway to get priority ?"
Hello  do you do letterpress  foiling or raised print on linen stock?
Is there an email address I can email for a quote of 5 different cards
Ok thanks. What colour foil do you do?
sorry
I have.
Thanks for your help
Thatâ€™s all thanks
i have a friend who is a graphic designer  can they supply print ready artwork?
Hi there  I've been asked to approve my guest list  but can't see how to do that.  Can someone help?
Cost of invites
but I was just wondering if you offer discounts if I order multiple items from across the design? I.e. Engagement invite  place cards  menu etc
that was all thankyou
ok great :)
Hi Indra
I'm looking at the Garden Estate design
thanks for your help
Hello  could you please tell me if you have the font Allexis available to use?
Hi there  I m trying to change the font in an invitation but it only allows 2 x different font types. How do I change it to something else besides the two I can select?
Okay perfect  thanks for your help!
Okay  thanks so much for confirming :)
"Hi there 

I found Sophia K.'s designs through withjoy.com and was wondering if it is possible to purchase a digital copy of the logo design ?

I have tried this multiple times  and on different computeres
Please let me know via email  avidehsh@gmail.com. I have spent a few days on this thinking its a problem on my end  but haven't given up yet.

Another issue to note is that it sometimes doesn't let allow me to edit and customize as well. I have to close and open a few times for it to work. It's also extremely slow.
Thanks
It would be hard to email everything*

I canâ€™t find magnets other than General information?
I still canâ€™t find it on the cart page. Mine comes up with something different
Status on order? Iâ€™ve stopped receiving responses to my order and Iâ€™ve already paid the invoice for 100 wedding invitations and envelopes. We need this order to be actioned ASAP
Amazing   let me do that now
Okay
The contact person (Indra) is on vacation according to her auto-responder
Iâ€™ve just sent the email from my partners email account â€œtchung.jm@gmail.comâ€
They were sent yesterday  but weâ€™re just a bit concerned. Weâ€™ve asked for them to be shipped to a US address but Iâ€™m only here until the 7th of February so Iâ€™m just trying to make sure they arrive before then
We have provided the address lists
I need an update on my order. I need it by Friday. It was suppose to shipped on Monday and it still has not been shipped.
I sent feedback to the designs for my most recent order. But I gorboy to
I made an order but I forgot to include certain information to be included on the wedding invite. I want the following to be included â€œ29.11.20 15:00â€ â€œdress code black tieâ€ â€œkindly respond by 30.06.20 at theknot.com/us/chang-to-chungâ€œ
Would like the Adore wedding invitation just as the Save the Date but significant price difference. Why is that?
Trying to find the Adore wedding invitation on vellum paper
Is there an alternative where I could get the invitation size?
No thank you
I left a comment saying to change the size of the invite but wanted to clarify that envelope size would need to be changed too.
Thatâ€™s the order
I need to send out my invitations from the US
Ok thank you
When I was told that yesterday...
Can you organise next day delivery?
I have been trying to call since yesterday and no one is answering the line.
I could only find the save the date version
That flight was non refundable
I have magnets here with me to add to the envelopes
No thatâ€™s it
Thank you!
I donâ€™t want foil print. Just white ink.
The layout options look like black and white
This is deeply disappointing
Why has no one told me this before now?
I sent feedback to the designer for my most recent order.
Thank you.
On vellum paper
I am literally waiting in Florida for this package. I have already missed my first flight because of this delay.
Should I put in the Save the Date order and if there is an extra charge due to dimensions I can be charged for that after someone has reviewed my special request?
Okay thanks
I was specifically told my order was going to be shipped Monday
Is paperlust going to pay the extra cost of me having to ship the invites from the UK?
Everyday someone says it will be shipped tomorrow.
120
So there is no way I can receive my package by Friday this week?
I sent feedback to the designer for my most recent order.
I need my package by this Friday
So exactly as the save the date vellum white ink save for the wording and dimensions?
The shipping date has been revised twice since then.
Yes
Is it clear like the save the date?
My guests mainly live in the US and Canada and I live in London  UK
And to confirm you ship to the US?
Could I not order Save the Date the out in special request that I want it to be Wedding Invitation wording?
Thank you
You are saying it will be shipped tomorrow
But the cost is significantly more
And I have outer envelopes to put those envelopes in to protect them

trying to get in contact regarding a style we really like  the linear wedding invites. They are white and black only  we want to know if we can customise the colour  either background or the text to something different before we purchase  we would need to be able to do this for all of our stationary. we would like a rust/burnt orange colour for the background with white text  or a white background with our names in burnt orange or all the text  if possible could you get back to me ASAP  we would need to order today :)
i also wanted to ask  we like the' linear' wedding invitations  is it possible to get the names in gold foil? i cant find an option to add it on.
i can find the matching theme but are the fonts a different name?
amazing  what would the addiitonal cost be for changing the paper?
thank you
could you help me with how to find matching website fonts? or is there only some that work with the joy websites?
white
thanks very much :)

Great  thanks!
Hello
Can you give me a minute?
So i wonâ€™t need the thankyou card until after we marry...
No that was all
Hi Carrisa. Iâ€™d like to postpone the above orders. Due to coronavirus we have to reschedule our wedding for Dec 2020
Of the three items  can we have only the wedding sign printed at this stage?
Hi Jamie  Just something big enough to stick on a 250ml tin
Yes we will need to reprint the invites with the new date
Ok
Which is why we canâ€™t print table numbers  menus and seating chart
Will i wait to receive the email first?
You too!
Hi Indra :) just wanting to discuss INV 860610492
Hello
No worries
If there is no option for white background or transparent background  can i chose this as a special order?
So just to clarify: 15 invites  15 RSVP  15 Wishing Well and 15 Thankyou cards
No  keep the date as is. Our dilemma is with the covid virus  we donâ€™t know how many people will attend our wedding
I donâ€™t remember what it is... savefor15?
We can still do stickers using that design and font?
Great  thanks.
Yes we will need invites to be reprinted  but donâ€™t need them to be printed yet. We will wait a few months before everything is to be printed again.
Yes  after the wedding
INV-63169019
Ok thankyou
Thankyou so much!
Ok iâ€™ll have a look.
Yes the seating chart and name tags will be finalised once we receive all RSVPs..
If they go to print this week  how long before I receive them?
It doesnâ€™t show the code as having been applied  so I have to type in the code
Ok great. Seeing as we ordered our stationary through paperlust  i believe the design we chose is rose et gris
Yes ok then
Likewise!
Thankyou for your help!
Can we keep the orders still on the system until then  and we make adjustments in Dec?
Thankyou ðŸ˜Š
Yes i need to check my email
No that was all  thankyou
Yes please! Shall i call you in the morning to pay via credit card?
How do we apply for the discount?
No thatâ€™s it for now. Thankyou again!
No that was all thankyou
Fabulous. Thankyou very much for your help.
Yes they are still on hold as after we get married we will upload the wedding photo for the thankyou card
Thankyou kindly. Our new wedding date is Saturday 5th December 2020.
I donâ€™t want to miss out on having the wedding sign printed in time for our wedding...
Can I please have 15 of the invites  RSVP and Wishing Well
15 (not 5) invites :)
Is there a Magnolia RSVP card avilable with the wood grain invite? TY Carrie

hi
"How urgently could I get birthday invites for my son? Last minute party next Sat 20th June 2020?

What is the best paper stock for wedding invitations with digital printing? Do you have to do the printing or will you send an image file for me to take it to a printer of my choice?
ah ok
since i'm not familiar with stock weight  i'll need top go to a store before i order. thank you so much for your help!
thank you. i like the cotton
Is the olive branch design a picture or a drawing? I don't have time to get a sample. The wedding is March 21!
The weight  texture & color of the invite & the envelopes is important. I've checked the descriptions. I have already picked & customised the design so I'm at the paper selection. Would you recommend cotton for the Olive design? Is it available only on stark white paper  or can I get it on off-white/ecru?
"Hi  

I ordered a sign for my wedding  when I was editing it looked centered  but the sign on the receipt is not! 

Can you confirm if this is something you fix prior to printing?? 

Thanks 
Cat."
Thanks for confirming.
31210049
Thank you so much
Can you also tell me when I can expect this to be delivered?

The order summary is also different to the confirmation email I got.
yep!
great  plenty of time!
i just placed the order

ok good to know.
Jesse's name should be first  I updated the position but not the names! just realised.
"Hi there 

We need to change the actual composition of our tables due to some late add ons. How do I edit this or do I have to submit a whole new design?"
ok thank you for your help I will get them through shortly
yes thank you I am still here
Could I email my changes through instead?
just quite a few changes so deciding what will be the quickest way to go about it
ok thank you that's perfect I will email through now
"Hi there  just wanted to check if I am adding guest names to invitation  what happens to any extras. ie. I am ordering 40 wedding invites  but we only have 37 named guests? 
Many thanks 

Catriona"
Awesome  thanks so much for clearing that  up. :)
Will there be space to write names in by hand  should we need or if we've accidentally forgotten someone?
That was it today. Hope you have a good one!
"Hello  
I have a quote  number 8530  and I was hoping to discuss different options with you please?
Thank you"
"Hello 
I'm wanting to get a quote on some invites. It only let's me select quantity for the invites though. Is it possible to choose quantity for place cards etc too? They only seem to come in packs of 100. 
I was also hoping to have names printed on both invites and place cards.
Thank you!"
Thank you very much
yes please. They will be the matte 300gsm please
"Yes  thank you. 
Could we please change the invite cards to single side. We'd also like to see the price difference of foil print on the invites too please."
Thank you
That's all. Thank you very much
That sounds excellent.
Thanks  just the options of linen and premium linen for the invites please
With the foil print option  we'd only like the bride and groom names to be in foil. Not sure if that changes anything?
Thank you.
Oh sorry  one last thing
We received the sample pack today  and are really impressed. Could you please add the options in our quote for linen and premium linen too please?
All good  thanks
You too! :)
That's all. Thank you very much for your help
Ooooh thank you! Such a huge help. thank you very much
Hi  I just want to know if I am able to custom my invitation and you print it for me and add other touches I would like
Awesome !! And when I use that link I am able to say I want foil on certain parts of the invitations ?
Okay awesome  thank you so much for helping me I will have a look at these links now
Also can I choose the type of paper it is printed on ? Or is there a standard type ?
Also would they send me a preview of the invitations before printing ?
Not at the moment  thank you
You too  stay safe
"Hi

It may have been my misinterpretation.
Thank you again. :)
Thank you for your assistance.

Hi there. Does the thank you card include double-sided printing or is it just the front side with photo?
it said it would add more to the price but it's still saying the same price as single-sided
ohh i see thanks
thanks just trying to see the price at the moment
oh okay it doesn't show that for me
it seems to stay the same at all quantities

Having paid extra for express post I am rather disappointed that it has not arrived yet. 
Express post is usually over night mail. Which means I should have received it today. Thursday (23/1/20)"
As I have not received this in one business day I except a refund for the express postage?
Yeah. Thatâ€™s fine.
Yes that is correct address
No thank you. I will wait to hear from somebody tomorrow.
Hi  is it possible to get a Discount if we are ordering a design without text?
Okay understood. Thank you and have a nice evening

that helps! because i would have not known what paper i used !
okay  perfect! thanks so much for your help!
or that gives me the option to put a photo instead of text on the back
okay  is there a section i can change that? im not seeing anywhere were it will let me change that
that everything thanks!
thank you very much. is there somewhere where i would load a photo as well?

Okay I think i'll just have to run with no sample. Thanks for the help though!
Great  that's a great help

Hi I just purchased invitations but just realised the dress code section didn't save properly as I finished - how can I line it up with the rest of the text?
no all good thanks again
It just needs to be in line with the rest on time but still an extra space between the sentence above as it is different information if that makes sense
sorry totally confusing it just would't let me save it
Dress Code - Cocktail
Thank you :)
"no - it stays where it is    I just need it to go one space to the right. the ""L"" from cocktail to be right under neath the ""A"" from clarinda"
amazing!
no worries
Is there any way I can order more than 100 invitations and envelopes? Im not sure why it limits me to 100.

Okay  Ill try in chrome.

I dont think so! Thanks

Ok thank you.
Is it possible to do a double sided invitation? So wedding invitation on the front then the information design on the back?
I'm currently looking at the navy with white ink  but want to see what the digital printing would cost.
Hello again  I forgot to ask at the order completion. I actually want to get a digital copy PDF/JPEG of my invite too so I can send invitations by email if needed. My order # is INV-472911058. I was told earlier this week  I would only have to ask when the order was done and it would not cost me anything more. Can you please arrange to send to me via email please. Thanks Elly de Gooyer
Hello  I hav a friend who lives in Richmond VIC  and they are visiting me on Sunday 21st June. Would my order be ready for them to collect in person (in stead of shipping / Posting) by then? i.e late Friday 19th or Saturday 20th? Regards  Elly de Gooyer
Can I get a digital version (JPEG or PDF) or the invite as well as print version? So I can email invitations as well? Please let me know as soon as you can.
YES  Indeed! can you change the delivery option to pick up - my friends name is Wendy Pollock.
OK  WILL DO - Thanks heaps! I'll close the chat now.
P.S. I left a phone message - no need to return the call.
Great thanks Jamie!
I will have to confirm which time is better and come back to you - is that alright?
Hi  I just spoke to her and she says between 4 - 5 pm today is good! Should she go to any special location at your office?
OK  Thanks I'll go into the design I like and come back via the customisation and buying process. Thanks again
I assume there is an extra cost? How do I go about order the additional?
OK 
"Hi There I have requested changes to my proof but Submit my feedback button isn't working. 

Do I need to select approve & proceed - even if not not FINAL? I just wanted to confirm and not accidentally approve it for print."
That would be awesome
Yes everthing should be white except for the menu.
Ok so for the seating chart it is First & Last.
back of the cards were missing
off to get a coffee!
Have a great day too!
Ok perfect. Sorry I feel like I've messed this up so triple checking!
If it can be grey ink that would be great.

Really appreciate all of your help!
Ok got it thank you!
is that possible?
ok I'm checking it quickly now
Menu is first names
Ok great
Yes correct. Sorry for the confusion
"Hello. 
Previously I placed an order for wedding programs that I turned into beverage menus. I am wanting to re order these as I made a spelling mistake and also add 'Soft Drinks' to the bottom of the list also. I ordered a special amount of 5 as the minimum through the website is 10. I am just wondering if I am able to place this order? 
Thank you!"

Ok great  we are also after matching thank you cards which has the same  design on front but we hand write the contents of the card. Also what envelopes would come with the above invitation?
After the wedding we are wanting to send thank you cards. Will we be able to get something that matches our edited invite design?

Also  how long would this take to get to Australia?
no problem
is the stock the same type/ quality for black and white paper?
Hello no that is all. I have paid the invoice
okay sure
I have changed to chrome and it seems better.
Hi there  Just wanted to check that the following invoice has been updated

the gift tag on black stock with white text
great  thanks so much for your help :)
I can pay after lunch  just at work x
We have gone to print but just realised it's still saying to print on the Paperlust premiun
"For the ""engagement invitation"" I would like all black text - (no gold)"
Also  what would the design fee be and what would I have to choose from with the greenery?
I think that is it for now - just really want to know when you think this would be posted ?
Can you please tell me what the total cost of the order would be for everything?
Oh sorry one more thing
The invite and gift tag on black stock with white ink
And how do I go about asking someone to change the design for me?
"The ""Information card is to be on white stock with black text"
Fantastic - I think the front has two sets of branches but would just like one in the  top right corner. thanks for your help
Thank you so much <3
Yes absolutely that would be so good htank you
one of the changes was to add gold liners to envelope. What is the cost for me to do this?
Okay thanks I will call shortly.
I will try to open in chrome
I love the style of these invites  however  we are having a spring winery wedding and the flowers don't suit the venue
I don't understand about the sign - so is this nor normally digitally printed? I want it the same as it would be - accept all black - not gold
Have a nice day
Awesome! thanks so much for your help
okay thanks
will you still advise on price please?
please could someone assist with a mock-up of this and corrected pricing
sorry one more question  is it $82 extra just for the gold metallic alone or for both the metallic and the linen paper?
if possible  just 'Save the date'  our date (ie. 11) and our names in foil
thank you!
wil email in coupel of hrs
Cost if we order 100 :)
Thank you!

Hi Indra 
"We have just decided that we don't want Tom and Emma Davis

Hello! Hoping you could please mock-up my invitation in green paper?
How did you go?
Hello  just checking in to see if photos of some samples I spoke to a girl about this afternoon over the phone could be sent to me?
hi Jaime - apologies  walked away from the computer... I think that would be better. Is that just as easy for you?
"Hello - I wanted to see if I was able to remove a set of envelopes from my order as I only need 1 x set of envelopes BUT it comes with complimentary envelopes for each order. 

If I remove my envelopes from one of the orders  would it be possible to change the envelopes to black for my order at no charge?"
could you please send a mock-up of the forest green with white writing for the information document
okay perfect  I will have a look now. I dont think it gave me the option of changing the stock...
I can pick the stock once I can work out which one I like :)
"says ""Information"""
Okay sure - how much would that be for x 70 envelopes? Also  one other question  am I able to change the colour out on the information design OR am I stuck with that colour? I do like the colour but was hoping for Grey OR black with white writing. No biggy if I cant.
okay sure - will it be this afternoon?
Or heavy?
it is the document thats currently pink/beige
okay sure - do the invite. On stock where it can be emboss... Then for the info  this can simply be printed.  Black with white writing.
okay ill look now.
okay cool... maybe we do that... do you think it would be nicer than the gold?
white please :)
does the gold still look good printed?
AMAZING! definitely worth doing the black.
Hmmm it doesnt give me that option
yes the wedding invite is an engagement invited that i have edited to say wedding
Just trying to work out which colour to choose
Would be really helpful :)
youre a champ!
actually one for question - would I qualify for the 15% off foil>
and would it normally let you select different coloured card or not?
yes thank you!
thank you that would be great
:)
what is the difference with the above? With the invitations. is the gold foil pressed or just printed?
I emailed earlier and the lady I spoke to put in to grey and black for me but didnt notice you had green.
so I can look :)
thank you!
Looks like stock is missing from all of this range of designs.
could you please mock-up in green paper
yes please so I can work out which one to do :
I have already ordered save the dates from the same range on vellum - they were great :)
Okay  I am going to take a look now and work it out.
:)
Thanks
Black envelopes
thank you
so I need to change to metallic
thanks :)
white writing
and yes  that is what I was thinking.. is it possible to see what it looks like in grey or black? with white writing. Then I can decided which way to go and place my order :)
That is everything for now thank you
thank you very much

i have some save the date and wedding/valentine designs i might want to submit as i dont see a challenge
so hope that is not a problem

when i go to my profile  it gives me option to submit for save rhe date etc?

last qs  if they choose my design   i have to give them paypal info
aah! so i have to wait for achallenge to be active to participate
thank you so very much for your help jamie!
ah got it  so it will sit in my paperlust account?
I used the site filtering to display options for â€œSave the Dateâ€ and â€œMagnetâ€  but none of the designs I clicked into mentioned magnets as the format of the product... only paper quality and printing style... can you help me identify which save the date designs definitely can be printed as magnets and what the related costs are?
I suppose the magnets are small  rather than the invite being a magnet as such?
Cool. Thx
Ok. Thanks. Is that the only format  thereâ€™s no option where the whole invite is a magnet?
Ahhh.. I see. Is this complicated to do?

Hello - is it possible to add a magnet to the back of my invite?
Great! Thank you :)
"Hi  
Is there an option to print guest names on invitations? If so  what is the additional cost to do so. 

Thanks!"

I'd like 50 more of #INV-22609694 printed and sent ot the same address  express posted. Can you please let me know how to go about this?

Thanks!

That would be perfect thanks. Including express postage
Just the invitations please  and no guest names  can you please provide the cost for 30 vs the cost for 50?
thats all - thanks! Shall i expect their email tomorrow?
"Hi!

I just recieved the tracking notification for my engagement invites - exciting! The only thing is it has a 10% discount for future orders and i JUST paid for our wedding invitations earlier this afternoon. If i'd recieved the confirmation of shipment earlier i ofcourse would have applied it - we only got 20 invites but they were very expensive... Is there any chance that 10% discount can be applied as a refund for the wedding stationary? It would be greatly appreciated!

Best 
Hollie"
"Hi 

I'm trying to understanding why my design is $14.55 per print? It is small  has no foil and no apparent reason for the cost? My engagement invitations were closer to $4 each and they had gold foil? 

https://paperlust.co/custom-design-preview/2PWpxIBO"
OK  Thanks Carissa :) One more question - there are a few guests who will be ceremony only - is it possible to have 2 or 3 without the luncheon info?
brilliant - and all the gold line/text is foil?
Ah  so because it's only 20?
Hi There - it's this one  https://paperlust.co/customise-design/4794/engagement-invitations--real-foil--garden-window-engagement-invitations/
Thanks! It's HOLLIE-PROBZ
wonderful - thanks for your help
Hi - We had our wedding invitations printed out a couple months ago with paperlust  but we had since had to reschedule our wedding due to the pandemic. I got an email about reprints with a discount  we would like to reprint our wedding invites and I was wondering how we can go about in taking up this offer? Thanks!
Hey  how long does it take for an order and shipping to get to you? I need something by the 20th of feb
I'll make this order now then
thank you!
Hmm ok
No other concerns
we were suppose to have a winter wedding but it appears now we will be having a spring wedding
Ok I'll do the approval as soon as I get it
Thanks for that Joanna.
Ok that would be good
Does that seem like it would be cutting it a bit fine?
Ok done. My order number is  #INV-239710053
What i'm wanting to order is digital print on foamcore (a welcome sign)
thanks for all your help  have a great day!
not sure the theme that we had for the invites will fit
Thanks for your help
Oh ok yup
is it possible to change the design a little bit?
I can put through the order right now  is that the same as the design approval?
yep that's fine :)
Amazing thank you
Ok
Hi team   I'm interested in getting a print only job done for some invitations I've designed. It looks like most of your cards are printed 127mm x 178mm.  Is this customisable at all?
Yes  that's exactly the envelope sizes I'm looking at.
Great.
I'm still deciding on what size I want exactly. Possibly 140 square or 145x220
No  thanks.  You've been great.
I see the print only option includes free white envelopes.  Would this still apply if I went with 150x150 or C5 or is that only for standard 130x190 orders?
Thanks for your assistance
Hi can we add gold foil to Linear Wedding Invitations by Jamie L?
any chance we could get the letterpress quicker?
Any chance somebody could send me a preview before I order?
How would I add it as there is no option
Thanks sooo mucj
should be ok
Thanks Novi you have been amazing!!!!
Thank you
I wanted letterpress on premium paper also
is there a big difference between the digital print and letterpress? sorry for all the questions
Just want to make sure it looks nice
I wanted the named in gold or rose gold foil if possible pls
once more question... between the premium and the cotton card which do you prefer?
how long does delivery take after order is placed?
great!!!
Ok great thanks
last question...how do i request the quick turn around?
Oh ok

I am only having a small wedding of 35. Can you do smaller quantities
I cannot change the name fields on the invitation
ok I will try that. Thanks
It allows me to change other fields
all good
Thanks for letting me know.
Thanks!
I wanted the cotton paper with foil. (
For the order of service  I asked for our names to be in gold foil. On the proof this has not been done. Can this be done?
No not at the moment. Thanks
Thank you. I will approve once completed.
the screen keeps changing and i can't see the print for long enough to view it??
yes  it chages to each screen to say previous or next but the background to view rhe print is black
Thank you! That looks great! please proceed

Hi  I wanted to ask you for prices and a custom invitation card

Hi

No  thats it! Thanks :)
Amazing  thank you!
Thanks for your help!
Amazing  how can I find them?
Just checking that this is the right website for the save the dates?
hi guys  can i speak to someone about consolidating a quote for a design i have saved?
"hello
looking for confirmation on delivery/fulfillment times"
it was sent 9 days ago
im on the page now
quote
$588
itsnot showing the version i saved though
i have saved the design invite in foil
im in the account now
656.80 aud and 588 sgd right?
no saved
but i have it in the email
hey hey
non foil
Thanks so much
Can you see my order in the shopping cart?
same
hi indra  sorry it seems i had to log in via gmail
oh its 115.80 sgd now.
ok great
"""finer details page"""
with envelopes as well.
"its actually 644 aud ahha. your fx margin markup is high ;)"
which is fine  but i want a non foiled second card
its consolidated it for me
thats the email
i have bank accounts in both countries so will pay in whatever is more favourtable for me haha
so i think its 127 aud
haha
This is an aussie business though right?
hi there
With the menu cards  they are not urgent because we havent finalised the menu - so would like to place these on hold until may.
i placed an order the other day. i was wondering if i can expedite it
ok cool
ok thank you so much
on average?
and thanks for confirming
thats including delivery?
2 weeks if not?
ok. In the meantime  do they also reach out to confirm the design? a
Also thanks for being patient with me
ok great
hi Indra*
ok so 7 days if expedited?
But everything else is rather urgent given the wedding is not so far away :)
Or atleast parts of the order. - the invitiation  envelope  and wishing well card.
so how do i get the designer to reach out today? so i can pay the extra to expedite :)
really appreciate it Indra
I was messaging you on friday but my laptop cut out - apologies
that would be so amazing! even gold foil?
yes :)
Im not sure what paper i have.  i just know i paid for the upgrade lol
so it will arrive  in sydney from the date of design approval in 3-5 days
nope- that is it :)
"Hi there  I accidentally added a blank page that has now been removed by the designer (at my request). But I think I was charged an increased price for a ""second"" page. Could you check?"
Yes please.
"I thought it just greyed out on the screen when I ""approved"" it"
Done! Also I think it's kinda ironic that typos is spelt with an apostrophe on the final click box. Very contentious apostrophe there! Presumably used because typo is considered a contraction of typographic error  but could be misread as thinking it's an apostrophe of ownership  and that it doesn't need one to be a plural...
Perfect. Thanks for checking that.
Thank you so much Indra for your help. You've been efficient and comprehensive. :)
They both look white on my computer  but maybe it's my monitor not showing the colours correctly.
Leave the background just the colour of the paper. How do I best convey that to the printer?
"Ahh  I see. That's good to know. Everything is perfect then. I can ""submit to print"". Thanks for your help."
"That's all from me. Shall I hit ""submit""?"
Thank you. Looks the same to me  but I trust you! Thanks for letting me know. I don't know if it's my monitor or my eyes  but I certainly want the background just the colour of the paper. So thanks so much for fixing that.
I'm happy for them to just print the text and flowers. Not a grey colour all over.
No problem. Thanks for checking for me
Oh is it?
Anyway  something for the grammar geeks of paperlust to discuss over coffee tomorrow. Thanks again Indra. :)
I got a bit of a fright when I got the design proof and it showed a second (but blank) side.
Hi - just wondering if your invitations come with matching envelopes for sending?
Working Files
Thank you for your time
Hi  I was wondering if it is possible to pay for the working files of a particular design so that I can use my own printer? Thank you
Oh great thank you!
Hi there  by adding contacts into my address booking does that mean I am providing you with the address to enter on the envelopes?  Why do you need an email address for the recipient?  I just want to ensure that they won't receive an email or that their email address will not show on the envelope??  Thanks
Do you print white ink on coloured paper?
Hi there  I was just wondering if you guys are able to send out paper samples?
Oh I see
Are the colours on the link you sent the only ones you have?
These are the colours I would likle
"Terracotta for envelopes
Dusty Rose/pink for invite
Almond for Details"
So you can print a colour onto the paper and then you can print text on top of that? Is that the process?
well it's not a blush I am after
"Would you like crop marks on the design?
Also  can I get a sample of a terracotta C5 envelope too and a vellum Belly band with a monogram printed in ink?"
Thanks 
Proceed with what
Do you guys have the colours I am after?
I like cotton
I am not going with letter press

I just want to sample a few colours in cotton/ textured stock
Is it possible to get a sample of that design with the proposed idea of printing colour and leaving text white?
Can you please answer my question in the last comment
I sent*
I just need to see the samples in person before purchasing
Or can you print the colour first onto a blank stock and then print white ink on top??
Oh  but how would you know if you like the colour before it's designed?
Textured
Ok thanks
Or have in stock?
You said you cant do blank paper samples??

And also a A6 almond colour stock? Please let me know if you need designs for any of these
Can you do a terracotta in the invite?
thanks
Is that something you can do?
No  sorry I am getting confused
Is white ink going to print well on the attached design?
Its more like a dusty rose
Yes  cotton paper for invite/details and envelope and a vellum belly band.
3 working days is fine!
I want colour samples  the design has not been finalised yet
I don't have a design ready

Hi  I changed my order to 51 thank you cards  but i actually need 55. A refund was being organised. Can i please get my order changed to 55?
"Hi  
Ive just realised i ordered double the amount of thank you cards i need. I hit 100  when i only need 51 (or whatever the rounded up number is). 
I got confused between individual guest numbers confused with the amount of couples. Is there any way to fix this???
I really dont need an extra 50 thank you cards"
Do i need to round up to 60  as i did notice you could only select quantities in 10s? rather than entering an exact number
Thank you. Ive just realised as i went to submit guest names
Oh great  thats amazing. Thank you so much
Oh great. So 55 cards.
No that was all :)
Hi! Sorry to be a pain.
Yes  i stupidly was thinking of individual guest numbers  rather than couples/families. I only need 51 thank you cards  not 100.
Awesome. Thank you again
Perfect. Thanks again!
Perfect. So relieved! Thank you!
If they have processed the refund  am i able to pay then for the extra 4 cards to be added to the order?
I only just approved the proof
oh my god  thank you so much!!
"Hi there  

i have recently ordered wedding invitations in the Luna style  and am now looking to create place cards in the same style. I was hoping to have them printed on wood  in a similar style to the ""gift tag"" Luna template
is this possible?"
sounds good - thank you
we wil just lay them down 
thank you
no thats all good
approximately 200
if a wood paper is available  we would like to have a look at that. however  we would like to compare the cost of standard vs wood if thats ok?
yep we are  however  we will use the standard paper for the place cards
yes please we would like the luna floral remplate
(hence why we were looking at the gift tag format but to use it as a place card)
(we wouldnt have the foiling  just simply printed)
thanks indra
we are happy to have them non-foldable
"Hello  

I need my invitations to be shipped to my address before April 15

Okay perfect
"Hello 

how long is delivery taking right now?"
"Hello  

I am wondering if I can do any invitation design on the wood paper or is it restricted?

Thank you where r they coming from?  Can you make sure they are put in my mailbox securely because it is a little rainy that day
My daughter who did the ordering for me did not give courier to leave at my doorstep because I do not have a top porch.  There are no special delivery instructions on the order.  All my mail automatically goes in my mailbox which has a little door and the mailperson closes it.  How big is the package?
phone number
thank you
Ok If I do not receive that day. I can notify you back.  Did we pay extra for faster shipping charges?
The shipping address is Joanne Tirone  42 Northwoods Rd  Wayside  NJ  USA  07712 which is on the order.  How big is that in inches?  Im sorry I don't know millimeters  is it in a waterproof bag inside a large envelope?
And what is that number?  I am sorry I never ordered before online

"Hi there
I'm making invites with withjoy.com and would like to print out a handful for people who aren't digitally inclined. Is there a way of just purchasing a PDF of the invite and having it printed in my country? It is not really feasible through the site for just a couple... 
Thank you

how much would it be to post like 5 invites to Australia?

no problem! Can I hit submit to print now? I'm happy with the design

"Hello 
Is it possible to order a sample invitation before placing an order?"
thanks
Perfect thank you
That's a real shame as I am planning to send out invites electronically only. I really love the design.
Okay  thanks for your help
Also  where do I select which invitation I want a sample of? Im not seeing the option
When it comes time to customize the invitation  can we work with the designer directly and have her edit/add the text we want?
Ah I see
That's okay  just a sample of the invitation we like will be fine
Is there an extra fee for ordering a sample of a customized invitation?
Thank you for letting me know
so the sample pack won't necessarily include the one I'm interested in? I like the British Floral design but I'd like to see it in person first
Help! My order does summary does not look like the one I just approved for printing... Cheers  Julie
How do I change a font colour?
Have sent a msg in special request...
How do I change a font colour?
Yes!!! The ones on the order summary page look like the original design I started with. Was worried  tis all...
Ok  thanks
Thank you!
Hello  I had a couple of questions about RSVP cards that I was hoping you could help me with
Hi  how are you? just chasing up the eta of our invitations?
Hi Novi  sorry for the late reply  yes its under Karen Tran. Do you know how long the printing process takes  and the eta that I'll receive it?
Hi  I was just wondering what the update on my wedding invitations were?
Sorry how long do I have to finish the addresses for the envelopes?
Hi  Iâ€™m at the approval stage of my invitation but do I need to finish my address contacts first?
omg I'm so sorry I didn't see how much the overnight shipping is....sorry I'm at work and keep having to leave to serve customers
sorry I missed the previous messages about the express shipping (as my computer turned off)
hello!
"Hello 
Could I check  do you dispatch the envelopes registered post. I.e. does someone have to be there to sign for them or do they get delivered to the mailbox?"
Hi  Could you let me know where online I find the Excel format for the Names & Address (for envelopes)?
Thanks - and can you do the printing of the names and addresses on them? I think this is an option with the invites (if I am correct)
ah ok...so I'm going to send an order through tonight which I think needs to be proof read  so it will be overnight from the approval of design?
You too
Can I get your opinion again? In your experience  what percentage of people do RSVP cards with stamps and what percentage write something on the invitation? I just wanted to get an idea of what is normal in this day and age. I haven't been to a wedding in ages.
Vintage Cobalt
any chance we can push for the 4th?
I actually need to post the invitations by the end of January/first week of February
how much is the cost?
awesome!!!!!
I gave Carrissa a Parcel Locker (kind of like a PO Box)  but wanted to check if this was ok or you needed an address where somebody would be there to sign for them?
I'm not sure how they work. Are these postcards which you put a stamp and address on one side or do they go into a separate envelope with a stamp. If they go into an envelope  do we get these from you?
Ok awesome... so when will be the deadline to finish the addresses for the envelopes?
ok cool thanks heaps :0
But one more question
you too!
oh yes I'm looking for expedited delivery :)
awesome thanks Indra :)
Thank you!
No  that's all - Thank you
I hadn't thought of the back of the invitations. I didn't think this was an option. Is it an option with my design?
No  that's all for today - thank you
thanks :)
Oh ok cool!
its deleted the messages... sorry what were they :/ sorry
I just had an enquiry...I'm going to purchase 60-70 wedding invitations that will have writing on the back and front....however I need 15-20 that doesn't have the back writing and 1 sentence removed (RSVP line)...is that possible?
I'll find it
no worries  thank you :)
Thanks
Thatâ€™s it thank you :)
Do people usually put an email on the RSVP card as well as the stamp?
Thanks
Ok will do ðŸ‘
also how much will it cost to have the express shipping?
Yes  I am - thank you!
great thanks heaps!
That's ok
thats it thanks :
oh ok cool  I thought it takes 7-10 days if you didn't choose overnight/express?!
I got it - Thanks
Have a good afternoon
thanks :)
ok thank you :)
So will the invitations arrive first or be held up by the envelopes
:)
ok no worries  thanks heaps :)
The whole shipment when it gets sent
Yes  you can send it via email - that would be great - yes  that is my email
(sorry for all the questions)
Can I also get ask (I'm not sure how many of these orders you see)  is it common for people to do the separate cards but to just put an email and phone number on it? I was just wondering how common this was
ok cool thanks
Thanks
Last time I got my save the date cards...the alignment was little off (it was move situated to the right...only slight)  does the proofing look at alignment too?
Hello
Hello!
Hi  could I check something re: my order if you know. I am getting sent to England where there will be tax on the amount the product is worth. Do you know how much they put on the package when they indicate value of package? Do they put the exact price paid or less the service cost? In Australian dollars or British Pounds? Are you able to tell what my package will have as its value? I am just trying to predict what the receivers will be expected to pay. Thank you!
Hi  We are making some envelopes for our invites but we are putting English addresses on them. We want the postcode to appear on their own line. Can I confirm that if we fill in country field with the postcode (instead of the postcode field)  then this will appear below the line with town and state on its own line? I believe this will work  but wanted to check. We will not need to use the country field for the country because they are being sent from inside England
Hi  I have made some amendments to my proofs. I just wanted to check if they went through? Is all I need to do is add the change and then leave it and your team will see?
"Hi 

I am checking out some invitations and RSVPs. I have the option of an expedited time frame for the RSVPs but not for the Invites. Will selecting the option for the RSVPs also expedite the invites? (Not sure if they only give one option for both or there should be two - the option sits below the RSVPs)"
"Hi 
I have just finished drafting some invitations. I have selected Winter Fire linen for the invitations. I have also selected Winter Fire for the RSVPs but there is no option to choose Linen. Can these be done in linen? How do I select?

Also  the RSVPs are coming up as a much higher unit price that the invitations which looks wrong. I also had the same issue with some invitations I had made in January and this was fixed. Can you fix as well? It says my invitations are 4.90 unit price and the RSVP are 7.92"
Hi  I have one more question regarding the save the dates. Our RSVPs need to allow guests to choose from their choice of entree  main and dessert. Do you know the best way to do this or do you have any designs which allow for this? We have already chosen the Winter Fire design and I have already started editing  but I wanted to make sure this was ok. Ideally we would have a little box next to each meal option so they could number. Can I request this in the customisation?
"Hi 

I am just designing some new invites on line. For the return address on the envelopes  do you have to select a design or can they just write the address in the same font as the invites? Is there a charge for just standard printing?"
Hi  I ordered some invitations recently and was looking to order some place cards soon. Could I check how long it takes to get the place cards printed and could I get the template for providing the names? I also wanted to check want fonts I used on my invitations if possible. We had two fonts -cursive and block letters. If I could get the names of those two fonts that would be much appreciated. Is this possible?
No worries
Have a good day
Thank you so much
Great - thank you so much - have a great day
"I am sending these invites to the UK. It says  ""I acknowledge that I am liable for any local duties / tariffs / taxes / fees payable on delivery. If you have any concerns about this  please contact our customer support."""
We are planning to complete these tonight and process tonight. Can we expedite the order if we need? I think I read somewhere we can do this. If so  what is the cost and how much quicker does it get done?
*system
I spoke to Jamie last week and asked him if I could use the country field to put the postcodes in so they appear on the last line by themselves (I thought this would work)
Great - Thank you! Have a good day
Great - Thanks
Great - Thanks - also I want to have printing on the front of the envelopes. Can I submit that after starting the design proof stage?
Great - Thank you!
Oh - thanks for letting me know that - do you know what colour it is? Is it brown or a borwn-red or something else?
Talk soon
Great - Thank you
Hi Jamie  I was wondering if Indra was in today? Indra sent me proofs of the envelopes last night  but I didn't get to approve them until this morning. I just wanted to make sure they were in the office today so they would receive my email. They may not start until later
I just sent you an email but I thought it may be confusing
I will call these people tonight- thanks - but the cost will depend on how much you declare the package to be worth I expect. I was just wondering if that would be the cost I pay or less than the cost I pay (seeing as though the cost I pay also includes the service)
Thank you? And so we can leave postcode blank?
Thank you
Thank you
I want to request it to be the same as the invite  but I don't know how to do this because I have to select a design. Should I just select a simple design and then put in the notes to match the font?
Could I also ask about the seating charts? How long do they take and do you pick these up?
or do you think that will look fine?
Thanks!
Do you know if they always charge this or sometimes they don't?
I emailed it to you
I presume the line above will be still centred without the postcode? Will this be the case? Just don't want it to look off centre if possible
"for the back of the invitation envelope the green button says ""approve and proceed"". They won't go to print will they?"
No  that's all - thanks - have a good day
Thanks
Do you know the website or anything? I looked up some stuff online and it said 2.5% rather than 20% so I am not sure if I am looking at the right thing
Thanks
Hello - I was hoping to get you again :-)
Thanks
I'm just worried the coloured print will clash with the black on the envelopes
You too
So I have to do a new one?
Great - Thank you!
Can you have a look at my file and see if you can assist?
I got your email about the proof. I am just deciding between the font but should not be too much longer. I think I might need one more comma removed  but I will double check and update the proof- thank you for your help
Great - Thank you!
Thanks - I will have a look now
Are you still there? Can I ask another question?
Great - Thanks - have a good day
Great - thanks for your help - have a good day
Also  I ordered some invitations in January. Is it possible to find out what font was used for our names on this invite? Will the new designer of these ones have access to it?
Thank you - can you also confirm what colour the print is for this design? Can it also be done in black if requested?
Really appreciate it
No  that's all I think - Thank you
I think I've done it now. Could you check? Thanks for your help
Do they usually charge on delivery? Do you know how much it will be?
We would just be looking at digital printing for the Winter Fire - on Linen if possible
He said this would work - but when I upload the file it doesn't work so I don't know what I am doing wrong
OK - Thank you
That is probably why I can't select Linen
Oh  for the seating charts - can I ask - can you pay more to expedite them if necessary? If so  how many days will that be? We 15 working days between our RSVP and our wedding so we are a bit tight on this one
You too
Ok - Thank you
OK - Thanks
Can I check how to select Linen a my paper? My design seems to default to Old Mill and I can't change
Because this is done via email and not the syste 
I am having trouble with the addresses
You may not know as this may be done by the shipping people but I thought I would check in case you do know

Oh - I don't want the Letterpress version - thanks. I will try and get rid of that
Thank you! I'll take a look
Great - Thanks so much
I'll give it a go. Can I keep the same envelopes or do I have to do different envelopes?
No  that's all. Cheers
Great - Thank you
How do I unselect Letterpress? I can't see where it is I don't think

Hi  I'm in the process of making our wedding invitations through you guys. I've  decided on the 'enchanted garden' invitation. Just wondering what paper is best for this type? Also if you could see if ive selected the rose gold font. Thank you
awesome  thanks for your help Indra
No I think that covers it for now. Thanks for your help Indra

That would be wonderful!
Is that what paper has been used in the photo?

How do I find your template?
Sorry to bother  I seem to be having trouble downloading  my invite list. I can't find the template I need to follow.
Sorry to annoy you.  I deleted the old one and the new one popped up. Phew.
Why can I not check out?
Yep done that and its cutting off the first two.  i tried adding them to the end and it said I had two too many.
Yes  it seems to keep cutting off the first two lines
Yep and I  am just trying to download the name list and pay but it saying it is incomplete
Hi Guys 
Have a nice night :-)
How do I find your template?

Hi  I just received notification that my order has been shipped but when I checked on the delivery address - I can't see the street name noted?  It should be C/- Hames Sharley  Level 15  19 Grenfell Street  Adelaide SA 5000.  It looks like 19 Grenfell Street is missing from the address - can you please check asap. Thanks.

:-( ok  I didn't realise that the mailing address was not captured correctly - I only checked the proof of the cards and envelopes themselves.  I appreciate your kind gesture  thank you.
Yes I submitted it yesterday not realising you guys would do the proof so quick.  I then uploaded a full new template about 20 mins ago.
Ok not sure what happened there when I set up the account...are you able to fix it before the parcel is collected?
OK will check now - BRB
You too Jamie.
Ah yes perfect that's much better - thanks Jamie.  I will approve the design now - I also just uploaded a fresh excel address book as I had one of the names incorrectly spelt.  Looks like it has uploaded OK.
23 names is correct.  I realise there will be some blank envelopes and that's fine  I want some spares on hand and I can do the envelopes myself for those if necessary.
This is what I can see in the email - no mention of 19 Grenfell St which has worried me...
The template I can see in my account has the correct names.
It should be:
Thank you so much  that's all for now :-)
"Hi  I am doing my wedding invitations in the Burnt Butter Cake design.
I cant see where the additional card im requesting is on my order as well as my special requests."
"We ordered wedding invitations earlier this year for our wedding in April. 
The wedding was postponed due to Covid 19 and we have a new date.
We were wondering what most brides are doing regarding a new date ?
Do you have any thoughts?"
Yes I have but I wanted a print of the flowers on the RSVP cards put on the back of the invitations. am I able to view this as well?
All the other information is the same eg: venue and time.  RSVP 31st July 2020
Friday 4th September.
Mum has been giving me a hadn :]
thank you

Perfect. yes that is my email adress.
Sorry   we will be going with printed version please
No thats  all thank you very much you guys are so easy to deal with

Thank you for your response.
yes 40 please and also address printed on the RSVP envelopes please
thank you  when it comes to ordering do I quote anything for this design that your have done?
ok I might have to change it to metallic ink. is there any way you could email me that design so I can show my partner?
Hi Jamie 
do you have the original order?
We were just wanting a wishing well card to place in with the invitations
Yes  it will be
gold foil
We had the Burnt Butter Cakes invitations.
I think same size would be ok  but maybe a price for both. I just want to run it by my partner to see which he would prefer

Hi just checking all of our sample design requested were reached as our chat keeps disconnecting?
Can you get Blanc mode in 20 cards? As we see 50 is the minimum??
We will retrieve the names soon and copy them here thank you
Can we get samples from other design as well
"Hi we were wondering if you do samples? 

As we are after a save the date sample ASAP 

Thank you"
31st of October 2020
"Yes thatâ€™s correct  just could not find the sample choice. 

Or whether our names & info edited correctly too..."
We have found the save the date card we are after. But the minimum purchase is 10 cards..
Is the fee the cost that is presented on the website eg $2.80 per card ( excluding post fee) ?
Okay great thank you
But this is the correct card design
"Amazing yes these are all correct. 

And we are now to wait for a sample design via email to see first before printing one?"
"Okay great thank you. We also like the modern mode. 

Does the back of this invite have black and white flowers?"
We have no website. Is there any other option besides email or number at all?
Are we able to send those designs to you when we retrieve the names
Yes thanks
Iâ€™ll send through now...
Invitations To Follow
Okay no worries. I understand. Can we use kirstyrn91@gmail.com please
The last one is ( type on line)
"Okay thank you for that. We are trying to see letter press styles from your link but have low connection. 

But this is our favourite. Do these only allow 50 min??"

As we were just after 1 sample of a save the date to see if we wonâ€™t to purchase the entire number (20) cards"
Thank you. We have a couple of other save the dates that we like as well.

Um
Thanks  sounds good!
So i expected to see them somewhere
Okkkk
"I had not customized any card  i had saved some cards as ""favourites"""
Maybe it needed more than one refresh and some time?
Sure thing
Ohhhh but then that should not be visible unless the user is logged in then
Thanks again
But
Hi  I had just received my wedding invitations from paperlust  they look amazing  however the colouring is incorrect. Just wanted to know if there is anything that can be done. Thanks.
Hi  I have a question about wedding invitations that I am planning on ordering. I was hoping to add a brush of watercolor on the background of the invitation  if possible. Hope to hear from you.
The invitations that I have edited are on paperlust website
I completely understand if there's nothing that you can do they still look amazing!
ok
yes exactly
the print is black and the card is white
ive also noticed that the prices keep rising in one sitting
as it is only white and black as of now
Ok thats understandable! Thanks so much.
You as well
i was hoping to just add some color on the front background
okay thanks will do
It printed more of a purple colour rather than a dusty rose.
I already have edited a invitation  rsvp card and information card
No thats everything  thank you.
in my shopping cart
Hi we have submitted our invitations for print and I have finalized our address book but I just have another name I would like to add to be printed please?
#NAME?
Thankyou
We still have 6 free envelopes
Shane & Lisa Blanchard
Great thankyou so much
Sorry there is one more I just need to check the spelling
Ok great
No thatâ€™s all
"Hi  recently i had purchase a sample pack from paperlust  on 1st April..
But I haven't receive my sample pack yet.
could you please provide the tracking number? thanks"
okay
Alright
So will arrange another sample pack refund?
so send me an email about the refund?
yes  that's the correct address
is ok  thanks a lot
thanks again
you too
Hi there  with the designs are you able to customise them or are they as is? In regards to the information on them?
I updated my email to reflect my new address  but I'd like to change my username to reflect that. How do I do that?
"Hi there 
We are anxiously awaiting out order to arrive. Is it possible to receive an update please? 	INV-80009712

Is there any way that we can expedite shipping please?"
"Hello! I have received samples and been working on a design in my account  and have a couple of questions please:
- The reverse side sample which I received had some leaf design included in the to right and bottom left corners  however this design does not appear in the edit stage. could you please confirm that this is included?"
"Thank you  any way that you could speed up them arriving to us would be really appreciated. Have a lovely night :)
Lauren"
Thank you - this is extremely helpful. When creating the proof does your team check that the copy is centred  evenly spaced out and not clashing with the edge design also?
Ok excellent - so included in the back side cost
"Perfect - Thank you! 
Have a great afternoon. 
Lauren"
Thank you
Excellent. Thank you. Would this be included in the total cost?
"Fantastic! Thank you. 
Is there currently a delay/backlog for foil printing?"
Thank you that is great. Is there an ETA on when the printing will be complete please?
"My second question is if it is possible to include names on 90% of the invitations via the add names function  and have the remaining 10% as ""blanks"". Though this would require moving the text up slightly on these versions so that a gap for names is not left."
Hello  can we continue the conversation?
Hi  please chat with me regarding my order I just placed
Never mind then :) thanks for looking into it
Itâ€™s $69.95 on their site and I just paid $79.95
Yes Iâ€™ll keep my order
For $10? Or full amount ?
I either would like a Total refund or to have the priced matched please
Ok. Thank you. Can you please issue the refund ASAP then. Thanks for your help
Oh ok
I just placed an order for brides business and have just found it for $10 cheaper on their actual site!
Thatâ€™s ok I appreciate it
Itâ€™s not a promotion though that is just their full price ?
Happy for you to proceed with my order if you can match  otherwise I will buy from the
As same price :)
Ok - thanks. Would just be a lot easier
Just thought I would check :)
Because itâ€™s PayPal  it should be more a less instant I believe ?
Thank you
ok so you canâ€™t just match the price and refund me $10?
Hi Guys  I was just wondering if I can order the beautiful invitations that you have on an instagram post from ten weeks ago  where you announced a new quarantine challenge for die cut stationary.

Here is a topline overview
Hi  I have just added my order to cart. I cannot see the special requests included anywhere. does this mean that it hasn't saved?
"Hi  I am ordering my save the dates for my wedding. Is it possible to add a small heart symbol on the invite and how much would this cost? Also  am I able to add a magnet onto the back of the save the date  and how much would this cost?
thanks 
Lucy"
is there a way for me to have a sample sent to me before?
how long will it take for me to be able to see a proof of what I have submitted  and do I need to pay for the whole order before this?
great thanks so much.
Hi  I have just added my order to cart. I cannot see the special requests included anywhere. does this mean that it hasn't saved?
thanks. will the foil sample be rose gold on white paper?
great thanks for your help
will the proof be sent to me by mail or will this just be sent digitally?
so the sample will just be my foil print with my design on it?
ok thank you
I want to see what the foil looks like on the paper
Is there a way to order a sample of my save the date  or do they samples only come generically? I would love to see the invite in real life before ordering the big quanity
Hi  I was wondering if it would be possible to change the font on one of your designs and how I go about doing that?
great
Do I have to specify the font name?
thanks
Hi Jamie  yes please how much roughly extra would it cost for 80?
Hi  Does the Linear safe the date design come in a 500gsm linen paper?
Hi  just wondering if I could please get a sample of the linen paper for my save the dates? The sample I received in the linen paper is 500gsm however the linen option I have selected is 300gsm. Thank you
thank you
Does the linear design I have chosen come in the 500gsm paper? Also is there anything that can be done to the â€œsave the dateâ€ copy e.g foil?
Ok thanks would be great if I could get a sample or have the option to choose the 500gsm paper
I was wondering if there was a way to order just 1 of my designs to see it in person before I buy a bunch of them?
All good  thanks!
I would like to see what I designed  versus a sample pack of generic ones. Is there anything I can do  being in the US?
Darn it - okay! Thank you
"Hi There 

I received my order today from paperlust. 
While i note that you say on your website that the printing may come our darker - i feel like my cards have come out far darker than i expected compared to my final proof and the quality of the photo also seems to have dropped also. Is there anything that can be done about this? I have ordered all my wedding stationary from paperlust and have been happy thus far."
No i didnt  and i do have a higher res one but couldnt upload it
No problem! Speak soon. Take care :)
Thank you Jamie
Im sorry this has occured
Thank you for your help Jamie! I recommend paperlust highly because of your great service
"Thank you very much - no need to send the envelopes or anything as those are perfect.
I have two versions of the high res and one is brighter - i will send that one instead.
Thank you once again  this is really amazing service"
I have just sent the email with high res photo
I think we should be okay using the high resolution photo. Thank you very much for the offer - i dont want you to have to go too far out of your way than you already are :)
"Hi it wont let me click on the Afterpay option ?
Cheers Mandy"
Question about the order
Hi  could you please advise if you print on our own paper?  Thanks
Thanks
Ok thanks.
"Hi 
I am a graphic designer and have the 'save the date' invitations already designed but would love to get them printed with you guys using a letter press style. Do you allow for custom designs to be printed or is it just the templates and designs provided?

Thanks"
i left a note about the font color for the envelopes. will i receive a response about it before i approve and proceed?
ok white is fine then
I wrote a change request about the font color but do they show me the change before i approve?
When will the proof reflect the changes i want to see?
recomend*
i was just approving the designs but we are ordering black envelopes and i wanted to have the font color on the envelope a different color
in the proof it shows the recipients name with a + between them. If on the spreadsheet that I submit I have it written with an & the way i want it to look will it reflect that when being printed?
what do you recomended looks best on black envelopes
yes
great thank you so much for you help!!
Thanks for your help
It is not a rush was just wondering how it works. so i just leave the comment on the envelope where i want the change and click done and then in a couple days a new proof will be sent correct?
yes i have already placed the order and received the proofs. the only change i wanted to make what the color for the envelope writing
ok I will leave a comment on it. Will you then resend me a proof before i confirm it?
"Hi there  I was looking at printing some invitations. I wanted to print red text on pink paper. I have my own design that I'd like to go with. Would you be able to assist me with this?

"Hi there  I'm looking at having an invitation printed. I have the design but I just had a few questions
The invitation would be on pink paper with Red writing. I'd like the name and another element printed in gold. Is this possible?"
Is it possible to upload a custom design for printing?
I also have another project on the horizon that may require a forest green/ emerald sort of colour card. Do you off anything like that?
Amazing. Thanks so much Indra for all your help

what size is a standard invite?
Great  i think we'd be looking at the hunter green

Great  could you send me a link to an example of your blush colour? I may be after something a bit deeper

And we're looking at this vellum and green look for another project.

could you give me a rough pricing on this?

Good evening.  I am ready to order some invites.  I tried earlier today and overtime I hit save and proceed to payment it tells me to to edit data and then I get a message to check my phone number.  The number is correct.  What is going on?
how do I get a coupon code...this is my first order and was hoping for a discount code
Got it.  Thanks so much.
I can't click on it.  It won't let me type anything.
hello
Yes please. So if I submit all my addresses now  then we can go ahead and leave the 4 envelopes blank at the front?
That's awesome thank you!!!
Is that able to be done?
Hi Indra
Yes please. I also ordered address printing and have got addresses for 56/60. Can we go ahead and print the 56 as I want to receive them ASAP as the wedding is coming up very soon. I'm happy to hand write the remaining 4 addresses. Of course  I won't want a refund or anything for those 4.
That was it thank you!
Ok. Can you give me a couple of minutes right now to check them and then I'll submit them?
Great thanks. So do I need to do anything regarding changing the order or will it just magically happen now?
INV-074810157
I purchased 70 wedding invitations as I had 75 people to send it to. I've just had 5 notify me that they won't be attending so I only need 60. Is there any chance I can amend the order?
Great. Thank you!

Ok. I have submitted it.
"hi
Im looking at the ink & nib wedding card design .  It says it is a double sided car 178mm high and 127 mm wide.   Those dimensions seem a bit strange? Can you please confirm I have the right information.  thanks"
"hi 
ink & nib wedding invite by Joanna H - how is this invite designed. It looks to have a fold at the top with the front page 'wedding'   then you flip open invite with other information on the second page? Or is it  double-sided printed card?  
thanks Maureen"
I am trying to customise a wedding invite.  Have changed wording but cant get the changes to be accepted on the template .  what do i need to do?
Can you tell me the thickness of the vellum layer?
there's nothing really to show.  I have typed in my name and there isnt anywhere to on screen to accept the change
I  started to customis but nothing happens? very frustrating .  Does it start with 'edit'? or is there another starting point ?
can you pleas explain how the customised process works?
Id
No its ok . I'm looking at the one which doesnt have the vellum. thanks
ooh - if its see-through layer on the top  it would be hard to read the copy on the first layer as the bottom layer with more copy would be able to be seen  causing a bit of confusion  i think
Sorry   dont know what/where the incognito mode is on google.
no that's fine. I'll source from paper shop. thanks
Im sorry but those PDFs you attached are impossible to read and doesnt show which /what action I take to fill in the templates!
thanks - I'll see if i can find a sample and see how it looks.  thanks Jamie.
But when the top layer is lying flat on the second page    can you see the writing on  2nd page?  If so  I think that would make the first page hard to read. If firs page was not too translucent it could work
I HAVE DONE THIS SEVERAL TIMES BUT THERE IS NO BUTTON TO ACCEPT THE CHANGE I HAVE MADE
Hi i'm about to place an order  and i'm seeing an estimated delivery date - how can I confirm a delivery date before purchasing?
can we add guest names to any of the wedding menus?
great  thanks for help Indra
that's the day I need it before
great thanks
i'm in the process of checking out
thanks again
great thank you!
thanks  just placed my order
ok  I can submit right now
nope!
we're also doing customized guest names for each menu  not sure if that changes time as well
thank you so much
thank you
I just wanted to confirm before I purchased
ok  so it should get here before the 21st it sounds like
so helpful

saved*
yes
thank you
thats right
thank you
so it this to just print one of each card?
yess
so if i place an order for 10 cards now (being the minimum order amount) i can then order more later. The reason being i would like to see how they turn out in person before i purchase all of them

Email Address : m.tasic@me.com
Mobile Number : 0488668468
Ship to name : Melissa Tasic 
Shipping Address : 1/92 Windsor Crescent Surrey Hills Vic 3127"

from my saed design?

It is for my wedding invitation  but what size should I purchase?
very similar to the one you sent as a photo but has leaves in top right and bottom left corner
this is all the info and what I sort of want the layout to be  is this do-able?
Please donâ€™t add any text on envelopes

"Hi Guys 

It may be too late but I am hoping to change one of my envelope addresses:
Liam & Jodie Hackett have just advised their new address is:
9 Dalwood Road  Dalwood New South Wales 2477"
"I have 6 invitations paid for as spares so i have only uploaded 54 names to my guest list. Will the remaining invitations automatically print with blank guest name field?

Also  a couple of my invites have 3-4 names and I notice the text box is too narrow to allow them to display in full. Is this something i address in the proof phase or will this be picked up by the designer?"
I AM ABOUT TO UPLOAD MY ADDRESS MANAGER SPREADSHEET BUT I'M WONDERING HOW YOU EXTRACT GUEST NAMES FOR THE INVITATIONS? I HAD IMAGINED FIRST NAMES ONLY ON THE INVITES AND FULL NAMES ON ENVELOPES OR IS THIS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Sorry for the caps :)
"Hi Guys 

I am wondering if it possible to have our Information Card printed on the back side of our Invitation?

We are looking at the Linear design by Jamie L."
Thanks!
Perfect. Also I emailed a query about the address manager template. Only a few of my addresses require both address line 1 and 2. Should I populate the address line 1 column first for all of them? eg if there is a business name i put that in address line 1 but if no address name do i leave it blank or put the street address in that line? Hope that makes sense..
Found it! Thanks!
Thanks. I was going to edit it myself but i wasnt sure if its too late since we are already at the review stage..
No I think I've been demanding enough :)
perfect
Hi Carissa 
Yep  great. Got envelopes sorted had just missed the guest names section.
OK. I cant see the customise page but now i know its there I'll have a scroll through and find it. Thanks!
OK great and we will get the opportunity to tweak the proof once we see how it looks?
Aha I see. Yes I will try that shortly. Can I just cut and paste out of excel?
I have created a blank back page. How do i copy the template for the information page into my design?
Thanks Indra. So I have uploaded my Guest Names and Address Book and submitted my final (hopefully) proof changes.  The longest group of names for an invite are: Susannah  Gerd  Aisha & Jasper
i just emailed you a screen shot
hi
hi
"Hi

Cheers

Can I leave it to you to inform the designer to change the time of the ceremony to 4.30pm

Thanks

Hello  is it possible when printing the invitation to have each individual addressed on the invitation? I know you print in blocks of 10 but we would really like our invitations to be more personal for our guests.
"Hi  

What are the two designs on the wedding invitations page banner?

Thanks"
Hi i am ordering the white garden - wedding invites by amelia s. i have customised and entered guest names but im unsure if they will be printed on invites? it says +100 gusest names / table number??? i just want the names to be printed on the invites?
Ohhhh I see... thank you!!
That looks like them
Thanks
also they will be proofed?
Oh ok great! How much extra is the cost of the backside on the invitation?
Also  is it possible to put the matching details page on the back of the invitation?
okay thank you  i have also written them as they should appear on the invites so if its two names in one box that means its for one invite. is that how i should of done that?
Yeh I would definitely want the flower element. Would that cost extra?
Does this cost extra?
No that is all.
Ok perfect!
Awesome thank you so very much :)
ok so it will still have the same flower print/layout as the details card?
No that is all thank you :)
30 at this stage..
No that is all thank you!! You've been extremely helpful!
Thanks
"so the first cost is invitation without the backside (186.30) just the invitation?

and the $192.60 is invitation with the backside details with floral print?"
Ok great
sorry so many questions
Thanks
Thank you so much for your help :)
Ok great thanks

Hi There  I had ordered a sample pack of invitations last week and have found one style that I loved. The style was White Garden but it had come in a notes format. Was wondering if there was a way I could order a sample of the Engagement Invitation in that sample to get an idea of how it is in person.
No worries that was all. Thank you for your help it's much appreciated
No worries. I'll leave it for now but great to hear I have that option. Do I just contact your team when I'm ready  to get that organised??
Not as of yet but thank you thats great to hear

Hello indra

Yes thank you
Excellent. That's so nice
Thank you
Is the above request possible
ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
CAN YOU SEE MY INVITATION?
I am also a little concerned about the quality  it was taken with an apple 6 back in 2016  which should suffice for a good pic but the tool has warned me about the quality  so i don't want to order all invitations without checking first.
i sent it
Hi!
is that the full email address?
does the invitation look ok otherwise.
i think i need to look into this and get back to you
perfect
absolutely
however i can only use a really zoomed portion
and i believe i can access them at full resolution  but im not sure how
great! i'll be in touch re: the photo : )
Found it. It went to my junk mail
Thank you!
I would like to be able to use more of the picture that we have chosen
i have saved all my pictures to google photos
No i'm not sure any more
will the first C in the address be included in the invitation?
Amazing

"Hello  
Just wondering can you change the colour of the paper in a design?"
Can you also do customised signs
how do i know what colours there are
how about the blush paper type  can you foil that
and with your wedding signs  can you get them to come with a stand
Like with the design in my history at the moment  its black and white  can i change the background paper to a colour and the writing to a foil or do i have to use that design
50
not that big
maybe a light nude or peach or something
oh i see
also do you send out a sample of the end product before printing off %0+
so with foil you cant use a colour background
No like just a small sign made
i am not to sure on the colour
so pay $30 for a sample of the finished product.
okay fabulous  thanks for your help :)
a sign for like a hens
okay cool do i just note that in 'special request'
and can you choose any colour envelope
something to go on a counter with information
okay fabulous
so with printing  can you do metallic printing or is that only foil like you dont print metallic writing?
how big is a A5 sign
Iâ€™m not sure if last message came through
Hi if I leave the labels blank on the envelope will the leaf border still be printed allowing me to write in at later date

Hi  is it possible to have this design without the letter press effect and just black font. Trying to reduce costs. https://paperlust.co/cascade-design/9344/wedding-invitations--letterpress--blanc-mode-wedding-invitations/
Ah perfect :) I've actually looked at that one already and it's much more affordable! Ok great well when I'm ready to purchase I'll come back to discuss
I won't be looking to purchase now but a quote would be lovely!!
More affordable stock I think
Amazing! Thank you :)
Hi can we change the colour of the flowers in one of the designs?
I see
For the thicker and nice paper   slightly shimmery which one is it?
Are you based in the Us?

How about the texts on page 1. Can I put more than that?
Thank you. Does it come with plastic cover too for the envelopes?
I have other question to ask . What if i order and the date has to be changed
I'd like to order sample pack
How long does it take to print and send yo me
The 343Aud  for 100  does it include envelope?
Thank you so much. I'll review the designs  tonight
I see great thanks
Ah great i will do that maybe
I see
I see
It's hard to picture the finished product as the flowers now have different colours ðŸ˜‚
The covid travel ban is still in place
ok thank you Carissa.  How much would it cost than for 30 and how long will it take to be done and sent to me in Townsville Qld?  Is the paper thick good quality and matte?
Can i please only order 35 invites?
Hi if i order wedding invites today - basic standard ones nothing fancy - when we i receive them in Townsville?

Ok i think i want the Off-White Cotton for the quote

"Hello! 
Could I add my own photo to any of your designs?"
That's great! And would I be able to move around the design  for example add the photo at the top of the save the date and then the writing underneath with gold foil?
Would that change the price at all?
I will :)
great thank you!!
that's great  thank you so much for all the great information  I will look through your designs now :)
"Hi 

Sorry  I just had a question regarding my design proof. I just have one more change I'd like to make on the time of the reception  but I was hoping to get some advice on how to word it + how to fit it in on my invitation? 

Basically  I wanted to add a line notifying guests that canapes will be served at 5.30 outside the venue before the reception actually begins at 6."
"Hi 

Just wondering how much your double thickness cotton paper costs? And also whether you have a 500 gsm cotton paper  and how much that costs?

Thanks!"
"Hi 

I'm just making some changes to the design proof of my Information card in the way of text wording + additions to the text.  Just wondering if I'll be able to see the design proof once last time after these changes are made? Just want to see how it looks  because I'm adding a couple more sentences to the text.

Thanks!"
"Hi 

I just ordered my invites last night  and I made a special request for a particular paper stock for my Information cards. Just wondering if I'll be contacted about this?

Thanks! 

Penelope"
"Hi 

I am looking at the wedding information card in the wedding set called ""Black and White"". Just wondering if I could request this be printed on vellum paper? There is no option for it there on the info card but it is there for the wedding invitation itself. So yeah  just wondering if it'd be possible to get the info card in vellum. Thanks!"
"Hi 

Just wondering if I could order a sample of two particular invites? I've already ordered the sample pack  but I'm just after a specific invite if that's possible? 

Thank you 
Penelope"
Sorry for all my questions! We'll get it right soon :)
Also just one more question  I was thinking of maybe adding an envelope liner to my order. When would be the deadline for me to update you on this?
Oh  the green line is above the start time and venue name. Do you mean  below that? Do in between the start time and address
Ok no worries  thank you. And also  just wanted to get an opinion on this option.. it is quite common to have vellum paper for the info card?
Ok no problem  good to know that. yes  ill do the old mill paper then
Oh Indra  sorry to bug you again! But funnily enough  I just got a call from my venue informing us that we may have to postpone! Not sure as of yet  but I think they will find out next week. Just wondering if there's anyway I can hold onto the designs until we know for sure? That way  we may be able to update the invitations with the correct date rather than printing it now if we have to postpone?
oh sorry  not sure if Ive logged in
Ok perfect  thanks Indra!
"Yes. Or I was thinking of having the line ""Canapes from 5.30"" above the address"
"I spoke with you yesterday actually  just about choosing cotton paper for the ""Black and White"" design"
please*
"Oh ok  yes I do. I'm after the ""Black and White"" and the ""Blac mode"". With the ""black and white""  I have 2 saved but I am after the letterpress design in particular"
Yes that's ok  I'll update it and see what they can do.
I'll submit the request along with the design approval
Is this because I need to approve the back + envelope of the main invite? Wasn't sure if the back + envelope were all part of the main invite (and I have edits for the front of the main invite  so didnt want to click approve before checking first)
Ok so the design I have chosen is applicable? It'd look good with it?
"Ok great  thank you so much Indra. And in terms of the changes I needed to make regarding the entry to the reception venue  I've seen a couple of invites noting ""Please enter via hotel entrance"" on the bottom of the main invites. Is this advised  or is it better to put this line on the Information card  in your opinion?"
But I guess the designer will check that out for me?
"I believe this is my very last change for my invite lol - its been quite a process! Just want to make it right :) 

But yes  about this point  I was just wondering whether I could have a look at a couple of options for this. Maybe putting ""Canapes from 5.30"" underneath the reception address in italics"
Yes I know that  sorry  I meant if I want it for a wedding invitation. The style I like does not have it listed there
thank you
"Ok perfect  I will do that :) Also  sorry just one more question- if I wanted to add a line about where to enter the reception (guests must enter via the venue's hotel entrance)  would you suggest I add this on the Info card? I was thinking I could add this if I wanted under the ""Parking"" section  and perhaps re-name that ""Parking and Reception Details"" ?"
Ahh yes  that makes sense  so its more recommended to use the Old Mill?
yes please  that'd be great :) because i have to go now. but yes  please email me
Or does that look silly? Sorry  just not sure with the formatting and visual aspect!
Also  sorry but what is the main difference between the double thickness paper and the Old Mill in terms of texture? From my understanding  the double thickness is a bit smoother? Is the double thickness cotton paper?
"Hi sorry one more question! I've just written up all the necessary changes for my design proof  however the ""submit changes"" button is not yet click-able"
Ah ok no worries  so I'll be able to tell how much it is by selecting the 500 gsm Old Mill option.
How do I make the extra payment?
Oh perfect  thanks so much for that! In terms of the vellum stock for the info card  just wanted to get an opinion on whether it'd be a suitable match for the invitation set
Great  thanks so much for your help again Indra - i really appreciate it! All the best
Yes all good :) Also just one more q  can I liase with the designer on how to phrase the invites + info cards I want to order? I have customised my invites  but wanted to get a second opinion re. wording and how I've put it all together on the template before purchasing
Ok no worries  so if I approve the backside and envelope  my changes to the frontside won't be affected
sorry  i just have to go atm
I put in a request to edit the information card  could you please cancel this? I'll just edit the main invite
Awesome  yes that is great  but I just wanted to make sure it looks good from a 'design' standpoint haha
Ok perfect  will we get the envelopes sent to us within the same order?
"Ah ok. I was actually wondering whether I should put it underneath the reception details  just so the reception time is in the same format as the ceremony time? with the ""-"" ? 

So it'd read:

Reception  dinner and dancing to follow

6pm- Water @ Pier One
Canapes from 5.30
11 Hickson Rd  Walsh Bay  Sydney 2000"
Just asking for a second opinion haha
Yes I have  thanks :)
Ah ok. So what are the options? I'm just trying to decide between those two and wanted to get a feel for both to compare
Ok awesome  and is there anything I have to do to ensure the designs stay on hold? Do I have to email Paperlust to inform them or anything?
Ah ok  no problem. So I'll have to make sure its in the mostly final form before purchasing
Ok great. Just wanted to check because I wasnt sure if we only get 1 design proof to review before going to print
Ok no worries  will I be emailed about it?
thanks! Just wanted to confirm with someone before purchasing :)
yes that right. so perhaps I could have a letterpress print invite sent to me?
"Ok no worries! I will put this line maybe underneath the address? ""Please enter via hotel entrance"" in italics?"
Hello Indra  nice to talk to you again!
"Oh sorry  and I was also wondering if I could have the actual ""Black and White wedding invitation letterpress printed on cotton paper."
Ahk great  yes I can see the difference. They are both quite well suited to the Black and White design I think
Ah  I havent submitted them just yet. Just made a couple more small changes but now theyre all good to go.  I'll approve the backside + envelope and submit them now :)
Yes  but it is moreso the designs id like to compare
Ok great  and then I'll just write in the special requests to have the Double Thickness paper
thanks!
Do you think it'd match the suite?
No not at the moment  I'll email you if I do :)
And I'd like it in linen paper
Ok great  thats handy to know! Might switch to the Old Mill then
Oh sorry  what do you mean in one section?
You too!
But the invite does offer letterpress
Great! So they'll send me the updated proof once this is done?
Yes pleasxe
Will do  thanks again Indra :) have a great day!
"Ok cool  will do; thanks for that :)"
thank you\
Or is there another way you can recommend? Perhaps in italics underneath the address?
Wondering  thank you so much for your help! I will log on if I need anything else :)
I didnt get the letterpress print invite  I just got the one with the cross-hatch design. And yes  got the linen paper in my pack. But I'd like a letterpress so I guess I cant have that one
Ye  great. I have managed to word a couple of them to our liking  however I've included extra information such as the addresses of the church and reception.. which i was hoping doesnt look too squashed on the invite
Ok perfect  thanks so much! Thats all I needed for now  will let you know if I have any other q's :)
so the invite with letterpress print on the cotton paper + info card wit digital print on vellum
could i perhaps just pay to order 1 before i order the rest?
yes  sorry  so where should I put the canapes line in that section? I was also just wondering whether I could fit this info in on the information card  it might be better suited there
Yes I can see. Great  just wanted to get a second opinion on it. Yes I will get the info cards on vellum paper  if you can get the team to send me the invoice  thatd be great.
would i be able to have the options sent to me in an email?
"Hi  

Just wondering how much extra an envelope liner is? Iâ€™ve ordered my invites  I need 80 envelopes"
Goodnight!
Yes thanks. I also wanted to ask  I have the premium white envelopes.. just wondering are the colours of the invites and the envelopes the same shade of white?
Iâ€™ve also decided I might not get a liner and just keep it to the standard envelope :)
Hello
Ok no worries  so that should look ok then
Ok great  thanks so much Indra
Thank you
Yes they have already. Thanks so much  Iâ€™ll let you know if I need anything else :)
Hi  I am urgently after some wedding invitations after being let down by a previous supplier. Is there a fee i can pay to expedite your range of letterpress invitations?
"Hi 

I was just wondering if you had an indication of despatch date on my order  #INV-338810376.

thanks 
Peta"
Hi  i received an email saying my second proof is ready however on the website it still says waiting for the proof to be updated. sorry to be a pain just needing this urgent order finalised today
Hi  i have left some feedback on my proofs however it is not allowing me to submit the feedback. has this come through?
yes it does  if we finalised design today would we have them delivered to sydney by this time next week with the express fee
Hey Jamie  I did i hope you did too  That's absolutely fantastic thank you so much once again!!
oh yes fantastic idea
can you confirm what the price would be reduced to for the wishing well and rsvp cards without the foil  if the refund would be worth it im fine with thaty
thanks
oh so sorry i thought if i clicked approve it would approve the whole invite not just the back. i will fix it now.
okay fantastic  should i place my order now through the website for all the bits and pieces and contact you again to get it happening?
okay not a problem :)
Fantastic  so if i processed the order for the $1614 i would receive an approx $550 refund?
i got the email but it didnt have the amount being refunded :)
is that an option
Hi  Am i able to expedite with envelope printing?
thats it thanks i will wait for the update for design to come through
okay not a problem  and apart from the 15% off do you have any other promotions or discounts available? sorry for all the questions we havent been refunded by the supplier who we paid in full last year and never delivered so just a bit tight on what we can spend
thank you :)
would that reduce the cost
Hi Jamie  i am looking at the minimalist black and white invites but on the premium paper
thank you
Sorry could you also confirm the refund amount for me as i was waiting on the final figure
thanks jamie  i have changed to the design to the rose et gris in premium paper. i have added the belly band and rsvp card do i need to pay an extra fee for each item to be expedited?
thanks  do you have an idea of when they will print and despatch
Hi
Ok thank you
If I may ask do you specialize in 21st birthday planning?
No thanks
Hi  I was wondering if you could print arched postcards?Thanks
No worries  thanks
"Hi 

We have ordered from Inggrid H. Neopolitan Ice-cream design previously. We are interested in the save the date and RSVP cards but were wondering if the colours could be flipped  to have the green on the top and blush on bottom?

Thanks 
Poppy"
Thanks for your help!
Awesome. Thanks  I'll get in contact if anything more pops up.
Ok great!
Great  how would we go about doing that so we could preview?
Could I ask for two special requests? We would like to see the design with just all green as well. Would this require 2 separate orders to see 2 proofs?
"Hi  I forgot to order some magnets but I can not find them anywhere on the website. Have they been discontinued?
Thanks"
Ok  I think it may not have come up as an option for me as I used the RSVP cards as our invite!
Yep 70 would be great!
Great! No that's all  thank you!
looking for E-cards for my wedding

Hello  I have sent in some requested changes to my proof and I got an email this morning saying that it has been waiting two days for me to revise? Not sure why you havenâ€™t received my latest change requests?
Excellent thank you!
Oh ok! Thank you! Iâ€™m so paranoid Iâ€™ll hit approve when Iâ€™m not yet ready for that!
Hello!?
Question regarding my order INV-39479225
yes
there's 2 changes requested a few days ago  and the proof has red dots against them
perfect thanks! Enjoy your weekend too!!
Hi Indra
No that's it - look forward to seeing the updated proof
great
ok  thanks!
yes
can you clarify please?
or should I click the 'request change' button on my side?
Thanks Jamie!
it doesn't seem like the changes have been made?
Can the same script font be used as what is on the wedding invites?
Cheers!
I can email you those 2 changes - is that what you're after?
can I confirm a couple of changes to the design proof for my wedding invite?
In regard to the envelopes we have ordered
That's all - thanks for your help!
also  one other change: can our return address (on the back of the envelope) be capitalised?
"hello 

I have a question about my order.  The address excel sheet that I uploaded onto the address book didnt upload correctly.  Some of the zipcodes  that lead with a zero are missing.   For example:  Beverly  MA 01915 shows as Beverly  MA 1915. I want to make sure that the missing ""0"" shows up on the printed envelopes.  Thank you"
ok thank you. Ill send it now
No I think thats it ok once I send the email. Will I see the changes in the address book?
Hello  I am wondering if you offer candle labels?
Do you recommend anyone else similar to you guys?
Ok  thank you very much.
Ok  no worries. It would be something I wanted to get for ongoing use..
"Hi 

I was wondering do you offer digital foil printed over the top of a colour image? I have an invitation which has a colour image background and then text over the top which I would like to do in foil."
Ok great  I have a copy but it just needs a couple of small text changes. Just wondering If I sent through the finalised version tonight would it be possible for it to be printed by Friday?
I do  itâ€™s actually double sided so we were looking for both sides to be colour with digital foil on both pages.
Ok thank you  Iâ€™ll send through for a quote
Hi Indra ðŸ˜€
Thatâ€™s it thank you Indra
I can send you the copy I have now if you need it
Ahh ok  so there is no possibility to pick them up on Friday. The earliest would be mid next week (11th)?
Ok thank you
thanks for your help
Hello  I am trying to change my invite from silver foil to gold. I have submitted this in the comments however its going straight to print and I don't want to approve for print i want to have the foil changed. How doe do this. I do not want silver foil i want gold
Will I get a second invite to review with the gold before its printed?
Sorry to be a pain.
ok
thank you so I don't have to do anything else from my end until the next invite comes in for review?
yeah i know i got it through for proofing and when i try and and submit my change on the front it says submit to print and is not saving my comments to change the foil colour
thank you so much
that would be awesome. I can see it has let me approve the back but the front is a different thing:(
no that's all. Thank you
I have an excel file with names and addresses that I would like printed on a coloured envelope I can supply envelopes or if you have a salmon colour envelope
Ok
Are you open tomorrow
I want to add another two text boxes to the menu i am creating
"Hi there
if I delete the addresses in my address book will this impact my previous order?"
Hi I submitted another invitation order on thursday I don't have the link to review the design yet.
Hi I'm submitting another invitation request for more casual invitations same design  I would like it to match the more formal invitation I am currently in the process of updating is there an easy way to match the same card colour and font changes?
Hi there  can you please confirm I have submitted my changes correctly?
"Hi there  
Can you please let me know how I can submit my changes?
Kind regards
Richie"
because that order has been ordered
also I'm just completing the address manager template for my other order
INV-17059611
its the same design but we want the same printed colour on the card the same gold foil
ok great

INV 17059611

Ok so I understand
Hi can we please request the same changes that we made to the invite invoice design proof INV-17059611.

Hi Indra

Hi indra

I've gone into my account and it says that I need to assign addresses for INV59659866

THANK YOU SO MUCH
it has been done
thanks indra what is the invoice number
thanks for your help
thank you that would be great
to the wording on the invitation
I can do it thanks so much

and thanks so much
Curious what it costs for around 75 invitations? then 75 small information tags for info for accomadation places
Its ok Ill have a bit of a play round
Good morning  I hope all is well. We have finished our design and was wondering if you could send it over to the design?
Hi there  Due to the coronavirus situation we have had to unfortunately postpone our wedding. Are we able to create a invitation with limited information so we can notify our guests of the change of date
Yes I understand
Therefore considering these unique circumstances are we able to process another order with you?
I dont see why it would affect the discount
Im sorry but I dont believe its fair
Okay great
Thank you
The only reason why it was feasible if due to the 40% discount advertised
We are wanting to put through another order with different information as the details of the wedding ie  the date will need to change
We wont be needing this order at all if we cannot do this
Is that what is being done now?
I hope you are staying well and safe during this crazy time
If we are unable to order these postponement cards we wont order them at all
What do you mean reprint the cards with the same standards>
So what are our options here?
As I said
Hi Jamie  I understand however this wasn't enclosed with me yesterday
Im sorry im a little confused. Are you able to send me an image of what the e-card would look like?
Are you able to do this?
Which is why we decided to go with a different design
We didn't want issues in the past and tried to be as patient as we could be
I understand we have had a difficult time in the past (which was our fault) but I am trying here to make it work for both you and me
Has that been understood?
Hi Indra
We have now completed this
Thats fine
The updated date is - Sunday 13th June 2021
Isn't there anything you can do to help?
Yes I understand that
Please understand from my end
However I just need you to add the design back onto my account so I can edit it accordingly
I wouldn't comply to a reprint
Im sorry but obviously considering the circumstances I require your services as our invitation design is from your company
We want to edit our invitation
but seeing this wasn't explained to us yesterday
We need to change the information on our invitation and just would like to inform our guests of the postponement date
Do we have the option of ordering new cards (hard copy) so we can send out to our guests via mail instead of email as we have a lot of older guests attending the wedding and do not have access to email
This wasn't discussed with us yesterday
I understand your position but we didn't account for more stationary as we did not think we would need to result to postponing in the first place
Its okay I will arrange everything and will update the design
But seeing how my order was cancelled anyway
Also next year June we will need further stationary so we will be happy to process orders from there on
I just want to make sure you understand that we do not want a reprint at this stage
?*
But i dont see why its an issue to use a new design
Indra are you still there?
Please understand from my end. It is a difficult time and would really like to go aead with this order
I want to add the design to my account so I can edit it myself on my end
We obviously would need to make changes as we will need to change the date of the event
"It wasnt our fault that you were not meeting our standards. Things were incorrectly printed and provided - I highly doubt that its your ""standard"" service"
I dont understand why you wont take future orders or help us
Hi I just got my sample pack and I am looking to understand some quotes and look at some small tweaks for my wedding invitations how do I go about this  thank you
thank you
Hello -wondering when my order might be dispatched?
How long does it usually take for things to be sent out?
I only want 65 invite but can only choose 60 or 70. Is there anyway to change the numbers?
Hello - I am about to order Info cards and invites in the La Butte design. I need to confirm a few things please if someone can help
ok thank you
Ok fantastic! Thankyou
Ok no probs
I just dont want to have the waste
sorry
Oh amazing!! Thank you :)
thank you
I'm just wondering that the turnaround time is for orders?
Yes its the metallic
no thats it thanks :)
have a good day
and envelopes.
thanks heaps :)
So even though those things are not available to order they will be able tod o them?
And we only have 3 long tables at our wedding so only want 3 table numbers but can only choose 5 as the lowest numbr
thank you!
the order is for the La Butte information cards and wedding invites
Thanks so much!
but do I still have to pay for 70?
i got distracted!
Ok will do
Hi Indra
also can they do silver writing instead of gold?
thats it
I would like to place our order
thats ok
Fantastic
Ok  ill put it in special requests
I dot want to place the order if they cannot do them as I want everything to match
hello
Wondering if the designer can also offer name cards  menus and a seating chart as they do not have options for this included
No thats it thank you :)
Oh ok - great  thank you :)
Hey Carrisa
"Hi! I have a wedding invitation in my cart at the moment but would like to confirm what the lock in now print later option is  ?
Our wedding is scheduled for early November  however should this change we will not know until a few months time. 
Also would like to see if you are able to provide postponement cards or amend wedding date on invite"
good to hear
have a nice day
Hi Indra ! How long is the order able to be held off before printing ?
I also wanted to see if it is possible to change the font on my saved design :)
and if order has been fulfilled no postponement cards will be able to be provided?
thank you :)
so just to clarify  printing will not commence until confirmed on our end and if it is 1-2 months after order is placed this will not be an issue ?
Also  my concern is should we go ahead and print the invities say late July to have them by August - if we need to postpone closer to the event is there anything available to those with invitation orders already fulfilled?
okay thank you!
Hi there  do your orders all come with envelopes or they need to be bought separately? thanks
oh great! and it's also complimentary to print the receipient addresses on there?
thank you
thank you  just waiting for itto load :)
Is there a way of viewing finalised invitation?
"Is the message on top of the invite included above our names? Or do you need to write something in besides your wedding details ? 
Rose â˜ºï¸"
i would like to know the price range of vellum print
"hello   how long vellum card ( approx. 300 cards ) 
takes to print ?"
i appreciate it
thank you very much
is that possible to copy the card and print
thank you very much .
ok thank you
is that alright to visit your store
thank you very much .
thank you very much
if i have my own design   do i need to pay extra ?
thank you
can i do rush order ?
thank you very much
may i ask    if i have the invitation card of my own and i would like to copy them in 300 cards 
thank you very much for your help and your time
thank you
what if i have the actual hard copy card   is that possible to copy ?
I was wondering if i could order envelopes with address's already printed?
correct if thats an option
"Hi there  
I was just wondering if we are able to order die cut designs yet? Thanks"
Hi  how do you add in the guests where it is more than one name on an invitation
Ok  no problem - thanks for letting me know! Just wondering also if you usually have a minimum order number for wedding invites?
I looked at that and it said you can upload an excel spreadsheet or type straight in - if you type straight in do you put all the names for invite 1 in that box eg. Sally and Ben?
Yes that's correct - thanks for that!
ok great and does that also apply to envelopes and printing names and addresses?
and if you upload the spreadsheet do you have the names set up running down a column in the same way?
ok great  thanks Jamie
and can I add the envelopes at a later date?
Great  thanks! How will we know when die cut has started  will you announce on instagram?
also how long does it take to print and deliver?
not at the moment  just finalising the guest list and I will send it through shortly.  thanks!
"Hi There

do you custom design? or can I make changes to some of your designs"
so i do that all myself after selecting the design
ok as alot of the ones I like are portrait
and the text color can I customise
but I want horizontal
I am interested in your Verde invitations but am wanting to see what it would look like with white writing instead of black. Is there a way for me to view this online? i cannot seem to change the font colour.
okay 
thats ok.......
Thank you  i find the black a bit too harsh
???
i would like it on the pink background though.....
Hi I was wanting to see if there was the ability to make a colour change to a design I like.
Oh perfect... I will jump on and do this now. Do I have to let the designer know or contact anyone to do this/
I have just done it :)
Hi Carrisa  Just a FYI that I sent an email as I did not know there was a chat function. So please feel free to delete this :)
Is there anyway that I could possibly have a proof done in this colour scheme...just I am unable to do this on the Mock up online :)
I was looking at the invitation design Verde Wedding Invitations by Jamie L. We really like it but were wondering if we could make the invitation white with black writing
Perfect thank you. I have just saved everything :)
how do you include the reception location in the invitation? and can the rvsp card have two different lines one for ceremony and one for the reception?
I see. I am also wondering how long would it take to print 50 cards and 50 rvsp
how do I sort it by price
what would the back of the card look like and the envelope
i am also wondering what does digital printing feels like compared to the foil
i see can I also include the joy invitation link for online rvsp
can I also import my guest list here
how do i know which one has designs on the back
hi  you have a dropshipping service?
thanks
Hi Indra!
No  thanks
Ok! we are a platform in latin america that connect brides with wedding planning for planning their wedding online and we want offer your print service in our platform it's this posiible (Not as affiliate program)
Looking at getting save the date cards made up for a wedding
Hello
Hello.  Could I possibly check up on the progress of my order?
Sorry our chat has disappeared.  All good to print?
Hi! Just wanted to check if my proofs were ready as per changes requested last night?
hello
I'm looking at wedding invites with the matching website  the design modern simplicity - I can't find a preview of the website?
"Hello
are you able to please un-approve the front of my design?"
Hello  I just want to check that I don't need to mention somewhere that the addresses I want printed are in my address book?
Hello.  I just wanted to check in regarding the changes I requested to my wedding invitations and engagement invitations.  Order INV-68757435
Hi.  I need to make a couple of changes to my wedding invitations.
this is what I'm looking at - am I in the wrong place?
Thanks@
Wedding is in 10 weeks and the majority of the invitations need to get to Ireland so would really appreciate anything you could do.
Yes that is correct!
yes I have
and because I have to order more than the number of addresses  those will just be blank on the front and the return address will be printed on the back?
"Yes - Ceremony location will now be ""at our Family Home  299 Whitepark Road"""
I jumped onto joy and it wasn't on their site
that's all
I know that :)
And also the RSVP date
yes
INV-68757435
yes
Yes please
I had that selected originally
Fab  do you have any idea how long this will take?
On the engagement Invitations please also change the RSVP date to the 27th February 2020
thanks so much
cool
Still doesnt work after refreshing
Can I please request to make one final change to my wedding invotations and then they are ready to print!
Fabulous!!
Thank you
Hi  sorry I went through the customize flow and made it to the checkout but I couldn't find the website preview
hi
INV-68757435
Awesome.  Will I get an email when its ready to check?
That would be awesome. Thank you!
that invite doesn't seem to have a website matching
or can someone update the proof for me to approve based on instruction from you?
cool  thank you
Yes I'm in the address book but its just not letting my ick the tick boxes?
thanks so much!
And RSVP date changed to 27th February 2020
Sorry can you also confirm that my addresses are good to go.  I had some issues with that last night but I emailed the excel sheets to Indra
it doesn't appear to be on their site iether
perfect  thats great I'll take a look
once I had submitted
I will also need to change the RSVP date on the 'Engagement Invitations' also
should it be loaded in under modern themes?
Thats all for now! Thank you!
thank you so much
!
ahh do I need to change that first?

"Sorry - can  just change the location to ""299 Whitepark Road'"
sorry it won't paste
If it is possible of course :)
I'm in the customize area
cool.  I was meaning do I need to submit the request to change to wording formally so the proof can be updated an I approve it again?
"RSVP date on both invitations will need to be changed to ""27th February 2020"""
perfect
Location to be changed to: '299 Whitepark Road' - I think that may already be done.  And finally  please remove the comment which says 'Please join us the next day for a bbq lunch'.  Once that has been removed can you just adjust teh spacing accrdingly?
Is there any way of speeding that along?!
Cool.  As yu will see from my dates I'm pushing it for time! haha thanks!
ok I'll try that thanks
"if it can;t happen it's not the end of the world  just thought I would try though"
I was just checking that it was automatic
yes i'm in that section
ahh found that page I didn't go through enough
Correct.  The RSVP date is actually correct on both  therefore it will just the the removal of the BBQ statement on the Wedding invitation
That would be great  thankyou@
INV-68757435
Yes please
ahh ok so I need to sign up first
on the front  I wanted to change the wording from CLOVELLY ESTATE to SPICERS CLOVELLY ESTATE
On my wedding invitations I need to change the ceremony location
Awesome  thank you!
Awesome.  Those are all good.  Can you please proceed with printing?
ok great. thank you I will wait for the email :)
As you will see from my dates I'm pushing the limits a bit!
couldn't get to that section  it had images when I searched for themes
Thank you very much.
Do I need to do anything at all on the actual design or do I just wait?
cool!
thanks
Hi again.  I am having trouble assigning address data to my invitations
Cool.  Do you think it would be done tomorrow?
That's all for now.  Thank you very much :)
I only have the aloha and branna options
"Hi  
I am looking to get table name cards (114)  table numbers (3) and a guest seating chart created for my wedding. I just wanted to know how long it would take to have them completed. I am just looking for a calligraphy style black ink on good quality matte paper"
Hi  I have my proofs back for all the items I ordered but I am only ready to check the 'Save the Date' cards as the rest of the items are all TBC.
"Hi 
If I have a discount code when do I get to apply it in the order process?"
"Hi 
Am I right in understanding there are minimum order requirements for the more premium paper types?"
"Hi 

I'm trying to order 'save the date' cards in the 'garden estate' design but the paper option of button doesn't work. I've tried on chrome  firefox and explorer as well as chrome incognito and the arrow to tab to more paper options disappears when I press it. I checked the wedding invite for this design and I am able to use the arrow. Is it broken on the save the date page?"
"Hi   two quick questions. 

1. I have the sample pack I ordered. The envelope sample is 'Paperlust premium white envelope'. It's quite small  I assume the envelopes for the invites etc are sized so that the invites don't need to be folded? The card is quite thick and I think the invites would look really bad if I had to fold them to fit into the envelope.

2."
I am trying to add the free included envelopes for my RSVP cards that are currently in my checkout card - can you fix this?
"Hi  I see from some of the designs they don't cover all the elements for a wedding such as save the date  invite and rsvp  order of ceremony  menu  gift tags and thank you cards. Am I right in thinking some designs have only a few items so if I want matching stationery across everything I should choose a design that covers everything?
Thanks"
great
ok so should I go through and just approve them?
You sent me a sample of the wedding invite with the silver foil we both liked it the best.
Thanks  I just need the save the date cards
I found it. Thanks
To create a set is it very expensive? The reason I ask is we are having a very small wedding for 15 people so the unit cost could end up being very high.
Hmmm  I can't see it. This is for the save the date card
ok thanks
and paper like linen?
Thanks Indra
don't worry  i've sorted it out
no you have all been very helpful
I have another question  it's about the envelope lining. I would like silver  so it says some assembly required
Hi  with the garden estate designs  some have colour palette for silver foil and some only show gold. Can I swap the gold foil for the silver if it's not shown as an option?
must be a problem with my oc
Thanks for your help. I've already ordered some sample so will take a look when they arrive and will be back in touch. Thanks!
But edit and create them once I have all the information?
Thanks  what about raised foil?
It works fine on the invite but not on save the date
ok sounds good. I better go  but thanks for your help
Ok I'll do that  I guess the other two cards and envelopes will be blanks that I can use if needed
Maybe. I spent ages last night trying to figure out why I couldn't choose other paper types. You might be able to see the transcript. It was only this morning I started from scratch and picked paper before qty and then it made sense. I think a lot of people would pick qty first though.
Lol I am missing the little arrow
You too. Thanks
2  Is the stock 'paperlust premium' the same colour as the envelope 'Paperlust premium white'?
Great  I am working on the addresses. Thanks for your help.
Ok great
thanks
I thought so as I was looking at the Garden Estate design and I seem to be able to order it with silver foil but at a lower qty  I just can't go beyond 'Premium' for the paper.
it works fine
Yes
Hi  I have another question. To get a 15% discount it looks like I have to add more stationery items. I am going to have a set but I don't know all the details for things like menus. programs and invites. Can I pre-order to get the discount ?
Hi 
cool  thanks
thanks for your help
you too. thanks
Yes I'm in chrome. I'll do that.
great
my partner is giving it a try
the rest won't be for a month or so
oh  I'm trying to work out how to take a screenshot
so if I'm ordering a 'save the date' card  and the paper option isn't there  can I request it ?
For example I am looking at the Ceasar Leaves
No that's all at the moment thanks for your help
Great. I have submitted the names but not the addresses so I will do that now
thanks
that's great thanks.
My partner tells me to update my chrome. Thanks for all your help again.
Not at the moment. Thanks for your help. I'll have some questions once the samples arrive as I can then narrow down what we would like.
does it vary by design or is it always the same?
Great.
thanks  you too
that's great. Thanks
I was wondering how I check the 'guest names' and also when do I add all their addresses?
Ok that's good to know. Invites will end up being $50 or so each if I go for the linen paper so I'll stick with premium! For Garden Estate is the min qty of 10 for  foil available on the different elements in the set (invites  menus etc.) ? Thanks
Yes your's looks fine
"no i think we will go for ""Garden Estate'"
you too
So I've placed my order and noticed that there is something about a free web tool in the same design ?
so it was a little frustrating
No thanks for your help
Maybe a glitch in my PC I can reload and try again tonight
"Hi 

I would like to follow up on my email regarding a second page for our order. Would it be possible to add another page in vellum paper??"
"Hi 

I've ordered my invitation already and it's currently being reviewed but I have a question regarding the 2nd tab for a ""back"" page? Is this pertaining to the back page of the invitation?? I just don't understand why we would have anything written on the back side of a vellum paper invitation??"
From 2 days ago was a different question
sure! I would love a quote
okay thank you
okay sure I guess the 2nd page doesn't have to be vellum
Sure thing! Thanks again. Hope you have a nice day.
okay thank you
it seems to be getting quite pricey for us
okay
:)
ok just got confused as to why that was an option
So I would like to wait for the quote first
we'd like the boarder to be the same foil but the words can just be all black
okay perfect thank you for your help
She's answered that one
yeah I agree
yes
Yes I just need to know how much first before purchase
YES
yes pls
so that we can use front and back side
okay
Okay thanks for making it clear :)
will they automatically fit the wording into the back page?
okay thank you

I did it fine on other designs
yes I am trying to. But it doesn't seem to let me type
It seems to be working now.

Thanks you :)
Yeah that design of invite just seems to be a little funny.
That's all atm. Thank you :)
Hi there  I'm looking at wedding invites.
Yes  i have a few items saved on my account
Wedding invitation - black card stock with white ink and a sample on velum
Thanks  I do want to go ahead with ordering a sample.
What increased the cost?
When you pick an invite design with white ink or black paper is the back just black?
How much longer are you open/available? Sorry  wasn't considering the time difference.
Information card - white card stock. Special note added about the customized size of the card
I'm just going through the designs again now
RSVP card - white card stock and black envelope.
I just order a design sample but it there any way to order one custom designed invite before order the fill volume? Invite  envelope  reply card  reply envelope  accommodations card
So $15 for the one wedding invitation and an envelope  and $5 for the RSVP and envelope  and $5 for the accommodation card?
Do they have an instant chat?
and white envelope
Thanks
Should I email or can i order through here?
Whatever size works best with the limited information needed on it. That could work.
*on
"I'd like to order a sample of

THE BWM - Wedding Invitation
THE BWM - RSVP Cards
THE BWM - Information Cards"
Thanks  considering this. Just revising the designs
I've just realised on my proof I've put the table numbers wrong there's only supposed to be 6 tables  I know I approved the artwork and I'm so sorry to do this. I didnt realised i skipped table 4
I can't thank you enough!
Hi Indra  Thank you so much! I'm so sorry
That is all thanks  hope you have a wonderful night :)
Omg thank you so much! You're a life saver
Thank you so much!
Thank you! So tables need to be 1-6 but still removing the name

"Hi There.  I am a  graphic designer who has just come across your website and it looks like a great way to get print design  and get it out there in the market place without all the hassle of everything else. Which I guess is the whole point.  I am interested in getting into this and was wondering about vector images that I have a license to use - such as water colour flowers and such that I have purchased through design websites or were given as a freebe from them. So the question is:  If I have a license to use it for commercial purposes  am I able to use it for submissions here?   Just the images we are talking about.

Thank you 
Simone"
Do you have to enter one of the design contests before you can start selling invites?
"Yes it is  however i have just read your section ""what type of images and graphics can i use"" and I think the answer is no =) so i will work up my own graphics first.  thanks anyway =)"
Oh good to know! ok I will download the kit and start from there  Thanks for your help
hi  i just submited my order and wonderig if u could give me a estimate time frame of when i might receive them. thanks

Hello  we're having a staggered engagement party where we are inviting some guests to attend at 2pm and others to attend at 3pm and 4pm. I'm wondering what would be the easiest option you for guys. Do we need to submit 3 different orders or can we do 1 order with 3 excel documents with the address and guests of each time?
Hello  I'm currently looking at the Diamond Love engagement invitations but I can't seem to get our names looking centred under the heart. Can you help?
oh good! I was worried I couldn't do it since the engag
my bad!
oh good! that's a relief :D
would it be best if I wait till we're back in australia before buying?
not for the time being thank you though
please disregard my question
oh!
I'm sorry -  I know I just sent this but I've just realised there's an easier option
thank you
thank you :)
oh ok so there's a seperate address to send the names and addresses to?
I've seen there's an information card in the same series but I was wondering if it's possible to have it printed on the back?
ah excellent :)
ah cool
**engagement letter is portrait the information cards are horizontal
thank you!
I have another question
"I can just put ""drop in between 2 and 6"" or something"
I'm currently in America for a couple more days and the website has changed to usd dollars
Oh I hadn't realised the guest names would be on the invitations as well as the envelopes
do I make the information card on the back of the engagement card? Or do I make them separately and ask for them to be done on the back of each other?
"Hi  I'm interested in your rosey wedding stationary as I have used the withjoy website and love your detail and designs.
Is it possible to get a sample of this?
We are not in a rush so just whenever a sample becomes available?"
Hi ok no problem! As I said we're not in a rush we won't be sorting stationary for quite a few months yet so I could get back in touch a little bit later down the line? If we feel like we need it sooner I'll get in touch! Thanks very much for your help  love your website and how easy it is to design/change aspects and the variety! Take care stay safe :)
Yes
Yes that is correct :) Oh my gosh that would be amazing :) as I said  we will definitely be using you but we are waiting for covid etc to blow over before we propose to our family and friends to travel to Mexico in a couple of years! haha
Great thank you!
sorry also just realised my email was wrong it didn't have the 1 in it. It's sophiebrotherwood1@gmail.com
No you've been very helpful thank you!
a note is coming up saying it a long running script. what does this mean?
I have a lay out of what I would like and I just want it on plain paper and nothing on it. How do I go about that
I have asked you for a quote and then you sent me a couple of invitation to look at and I have gone into this and started to change it via your link that you sent me
how do you do a screen shot
Okay sound good. I also need RSVP cards thanks
it's asking me to login again
I think I have to start again
okay thankyou
yes I'm trying to write my invitation
great thankyou
Hi  I received an email to approve the guest list details however I cannot find where to do that? The page says that the invitations and RSVP's are in production? Does that mean I was to late?
"There are 3 names who were lastish on the list. I had them down as Mitch & Partner  Thomas & partner and Sam & partner. 


I would like them to please say: 
Mitchell and Nikki"
okay
no thats all thank you
Sam and Chloe
yes this is correct  am I able to potentially make an amendment to 3 of them? I was able to confirm some details? or is it to late?
one more quick question sorry  how long does it usually take for them to arrive?
Thomas and Sam
too easy thank you
no worries  thanks
oh super quick! Thats awesome! I was expecting like a good 2 months.  but this is great. Thank you so much!
"Did you receive the guest list.
We do not want Stacey on every card"
Ok  I have approved.
Probably delivery time - wedding on the 14th March
Thankyou
Hi I am just enquiring about my order INV-750910267 and if there has been any updates with the progress of the order? I approved in last week I just wanted to follow-up
"Hi I am just enquiring about my order INV-750910267. I have approved some of the proofs but the three information cards and the RSVP card needs changes. Can you please confirm that the changes I have asked for have been saved and what is the next process from here?
How long do I wait for the changes to be reviewed?"
Hi I am currently working on making changes to my set that I have saved in my account the BWM belly bands  information cards and RSVP cards and for some reason when i make specific changes on moving the boxed words it reverts it back to its original look prior to the change made despite me saving it. I was hoping you could assist with this. It is really the spacing between two names and moving a paragraph of writing a little more to the left.
I'm having trouble printing on the A7 envelopes
Hi I am just requiring some assistance regarding my order#INV-80389751. I placed this order through on the 21 January 2020 so yesterday and confirmed by address book  however I have realised this morning I there was a person missing from the address book and another person's name was incorrectly spelt. Can I re-submit the address book with these changes?
"Hi there  

I was just wanting to know how long it takes for an email response?"
thank you for your assistance
thanks good to know!
For the BWM RSVP cards it has for some reason added envelopes for free of charge
yes thats correct - I was also wanting to know if I have metallic print on the front and back this changes the cost?
perfect thanks so much for your assistance
not a problem. thanks for your assistance :)
ok I just wanted to check prior to adding it to my cart. So it i just add a special request it will be fine
ok not a problem
night*
I am just checking now the list you sent through was correct
ok
if so  I can't seem to add me postal address on the front of the envelope as there is no option for that
excellent thankyou so much - and one last question is it possible to see one printed before printing the remainder?
I have another question
so once I receive this list via email can I make amendments and send it back?
ok great!
have a good day :)
do I need those envelopes?
ok perfect
however I was unable to send this through
thankyou
Thanks.
those cards already have a section on it for the stamp
perfect thanks for you help
would they be shipped by early next week?
I have since updated my address book
ok not a problem. thanks for your assistance
the address book may have updated itself?
ok - & is payment made before or after the job is completed?
ok perfect not a problem. It was just very strange because it worked on the invite and other areas of the those cards just after I made the change it removed the change
yes I sent one last nigh
no thats all thankyou :)
thank you
no thats fine thank you for your assistance
no thats fine thanks
yes perfect. can you refer to the address book and not the one I submitted
Hi I am just following up two envelopes that arrived in my ordered that weâ€™re going to be changed and sent out again. My order number is INV-05305721. I spoke with Joanna last week on Friday who reported this would be sent out on Monday. I was just hoping to follow up to see when this would arrive?
"Hi I just received my order INV-05305721 and one of the envelopes had a misprint with a surname and another had some ink that must of come off from the printer. Is it possible to just get these two envelopes amended? 
The misprint was my fault and I do apologise for this  two letters just need to be switched around"
Hi I just need some assistance. I am trying to put together my wedding invites and I am adding the information cards. I need to complete 3 different sets of the information cards given the information of each will be different. When I go to try and do that it just goes back to the one i have already saved. Is there a way I can use the BWM information cards but have different information on each?
Yes thatâ€™s correct
6 Honeyeater Close  Farmborough Heights  NSW 2526 Australia
Sorry this is the order number
ok
No that is all. Thank you for your assistance
Not a problem
did you want me to email you or just write it in the chat?
Sorry I spoke with Joanna about this on Friday she said that two envelopes can be sent out immediately.
Michael & Stephanie
perfect
Ok not a problem. Sure that is fine via email
14B Murrogun Crescent Cordeaux Heights  NSW 2526 Australia
Two envelopes just needed to be changed. One had ink smudged on it and the other was just incorrectly spelt in the surname
Mome & Diana Stojcevski
Address for Michael & Stephanie:
INV-750910267
So see below:
Not a problem. I will be ordering them tonight so will send through an email later on.
perfect thanks for your help :)
the address for Mome and Diana is:
no that is all. thank you for your assistance :)
I'm trying to get into the design to edit it and I also want my daughter to see this.  She lives in Portland and I'm in Southern Cal so I need her to access it online to look at it.  Your site is extremely difficult to navigate to accomplish these things.  please help.
Hi there  just wonder how long order processing going to take?
contact number of richmond office
price inquiry
Reschedule appointment
that's very close to where I live
Ive spoken with consultant  she mentioned the unit price of 25 and 30 copies are the same
Awesome!
could you double check to see if the design is anywhere in your system?
say if I order invitation card plus thank you card plus information card  do you usually give bit discount?
original schedule was 6pm
my text on the front was not saved and it says I will be charged extra now for this text.
but the consultant mentioned the unit price of 25 invitation would be same as 30
beautiful. speak soon
so that I know how many ppl would attend
what's unit price of Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays Wedding Invitation Card if I order 30 with Metallic design?
any chance I can bring it forward to 5pm?
why wasn't the front side design saved??!  It already wasn't saved once before so I had to re-do it a second time. I thought it was b/c I hadn't checked out so I did that on purpose to save it. this is very disappointing
I have already picked a design
which I believe it only costs $5.44
thanks for checking
Hmm it's bit tricky. I am thinking to order invitation card  information card  menu  table number  place name
ah  ok. thanks
"Printed Metallic Ink on 300 GSM Matt
Invitation (178mm x 127mm) $8.94 x 25 = $223.5"
so if I order sth online now
Right. it's very confusing. I'll just give her to call to sort it out maybe
"as you mentioned there's ""card"" only"
*order
please standby while I check
Is there going to have someone proof my writing etc before it's finalised?
I also got charged $6.52 with information card in the same set
are you on swan st right?
*where about in Aus
Ok sure. Thanks for your help
ok thats all I need to know
unless I purchase envelop too  which I am not sure if it's part of the discount offer
Do ppl usually have appointment before they place the orferï¼Ÿ
yes I think it's easier and quicker to pick up
so I assumed I should be charged less
Thanks a lot
yes
Hmm I see. where about are you shipping from?
How can I be assured that it will be saved on this third try? I don't think I need help at this stage yet. It's just type into your format.  I just need assurance that it will be saved this time. Also  I don't think I need the design help if I need to pay extra.
yes you can. handash@aol.com
which cannot be considered as same batch as the other ones
great.  I cant even get to the design to edit it.
same day
but the invitation card and information card have to be delivered first
This is what I got billed.
ok. again  I did save it- twice! when will the designer be able to assist me?
do i need to start all over again? it's not just a simple type to you in this chat box
how to inform you about pick up service?
Thanks for your help
ok. In the meantime  I don't think I will put the effort into a third try with the design until I hear from you.  Are you on Pacific Standard time?
Hi there
Hi there
Hi
"Hi
Can I please have a digital copy of my order"
"Hi there  what does ""assign data to birthday invitations"" mean?"
?
Hello
Hi I canâ€™t see anything
Hi there
"Hi there 

I accidentally approved the invitation when I shouldnâ€™t have. Is it too late to make further amendments?"
"Hi there 

Do you custom make invitations?"
Hi there
I'm trying to find the chat log about using one of your templates for a baptism inviation
Can that be fixed?
Ok thank you
But not printed yet
Thank you
No thanks
Perhaps instead of the grey or green confetti  it be yellow instead?
He sent me a link for a wedding invitation with gold foiling
Not on the actual invitations?
Is there a further discount?
So it should read â€œRSVP by 22 September to Tam 0402 889 959â€
I actually submitted them to print
Thank you
Can you please tell me how much more it would cost to add a magnet to the back of the invitations?
All I can see is the done button
Does the 20% apply to this invitation?
I just wanted to remove the â€œ2020â€ fro
Can the invitations be edited?
Thank you!
Thank you
Thatâ€™s fine. As long as youâ€™re able to do the watermark background and the gold foiling writing in the same font
Great
Might have been with someone else
There is a chat log about a wedding invitation which can be done as a baptism invitation
Ok no worries  I will select all then
Ok no worries
Ok great

Could I also order an electronic version to send via email to some guests?
Can I please get a digital copy of the invitation I ordered?
I've just uploaded the excel spreadsheet to address manager
It was about a custom order but he suggested using your own template
Still at the revision stage
Thanks!
There should be other chat logs
Some won't have addresses as they will be hand delivered
We like this design however we were just wondering if we could have yellow confetti instead of one of the other colours?
No it wasn't that one
however I got a spelling incorrect
Okay great
As well as paper invitations
Yes that's the one thank you!
I think it could have been Jaime
Okay great Iâ€™m happy to pay the extra
But keeping the blues
Can I please add them to the order ?
Yes it's been received
because I already bought some invitations?
I also asked for more yellow splashes but didnâ€™t get that either
Yes thank you
I'll do that
I currently have an order in place
Thank you
Printed on the envelope?
from the RSVP sentence and move my name and number onto the same sentence
Can I show you what Iâ€™m after
https://paperlust.co/cascade-design/4193/birthday-invitations--digital-cards--watercolour-pop-birthday-invitations/
Can you please send me the link from the chat where the rep suggested a wedding invitation for a baptism
Thank you
Sorry Ido
Okay which one is that?
No my order has been processed
Also  apparently there is an additional cost for the back. Is it for the total or per card?
Is this something you can replicate?
Yes
we were talking about a custom order
Yes
"Should be spelt ""Kaine"""
I purchased some invitations yesterday but I just saw that there is a discount?
"To whom it may concern  

I currently have 3 cards (invite  info and RSVP) for our wedding sitting in my cart. Is there an option to be sent a draft before paying for the full set  OR do you just have to buy and hope they are what you expected?

Thank you so much!

Tanika Pember"
Hi there! I missed the 15% off discount code on the screen ðŸ˜’ now Iâ€™m at the checkout and I canâ€™t see it
Thankyou
A little tab popped up before me adding it to my cart and it said 15 % off

"Hi
My son and his fiancee are wanting to personalise their wedding invitations (i.e. write the names of each couple  or in some instances couple and their children's names) is this possible with the online wedding invitations that are available through your company?
Thank you.  Tessa"
That's fantastic  James.  Thanks very much.  So  does that mean that we do not send out the invitations  but your company does?  Sorry  I've just come through the website and haven't read through all the detail
Thanks for your help James.
"Hi Paper Lust. I've got a few questions.

1. If I submit order today  what is the earliest date our invitations could be ready?

2. How do I attach list for names the invites are to be made out to? 

3. Are comma's ok to use on the invite? 

Eg Lisa  Andy and Jacob 
The comma on the preview shows up as a symbol."
"Hi Paper Lust
How do we add individual guests names?"
Thanks heaps Indra. Will do.
Blank as in no printed guest names
Also are there only 3 font choices for this invite?\
Thank you for your help once again.
Thank you. So each invitation can be printed differently ie addressed to specific guest?
Thanks Indra. Much appreciated.
Thanks re: font. Re: timeline if it's a basic print and submitted this ASAP could they be ready mid next week?
Hi Indra
Hi Indra
Thank you for your help

Great.
Same to you.

Hello Indra
i have been combing the net and I keep coming back to this invitation  lol
i canâ€™t edit because I own and iPad
That is great to know
i think my order is going  to be under $300
Yes
Ok  great!
No  I am good for right now
this is my 50th birthday
can you give me an idea of how much shipping is to the US 98031
you too
The coloring of this invitation looks holographic and says that it is foiled  but will the foiling actual be holographic (multicolored)?
that would be good
But could we add a disco ball? :)
is there a way to add a custom image or illustration to one of the existing templates. For example we are looking at this design
you have been so helpful. one last question (I think this is the last...)
sorry sent prematurely
Do this template only allow for editing to be done on the front side?
We are playing around with it now. Is there a way so
OK. super. thank you so much
the white printing. What would the additional cost of that be per invitation
ok thank you
that's perfect. Thats what I'm looking for. Seems like when we customize the text  it goes to all one color  but we would want the holographic multi color.
got it

"Hello  I am trying to make a template for my wedding invitations. We picked the white garden design mostly because it comes with the option of using ""joy"" and create a website. I am curious how am I able to use this option and will the website be able to record rsvp's. thank you"
im just wondering because now I've also looked at the joy website I think ill get a better deal purchasing my invite straight from them
perfect! thank you
Hi there  apologies I stepped away from my desk.
"Hi there 
Just following up on a quote. I had asked a question  and hadn't heard back.
We are keen to place the order in the next day or two max. 
Many thanks in advance."
"Hi there 
Do you have any light brown / tan / sand coloured paper for wedding invites? My client isn't particularly keen on the grey or kraft. 
Many thanks in advance!
Vicky."
The colour of the top one here is quite nice and still natural. What would be the closest to this>
Maybe Cotton and Matt just to compare?
Amazing - thank you!

Do you have any examples of the latte and natural on the browse designs page?
And would the almond / latte / sand etc be a similar price to the natural?
I quite like the latte  but I think she'll find it too dark. Are you able to send a shot of them next to the natural paper as per the rosa / blush above?
I believe it will be about 80 invites.

And yes  that's the correct email.
So approx 30c more expensive per unit. Ok excellent!
?
Ok that could work  can I get a quote for double sided digital colour  with black copy one sided. Still finessing the design but this is the latest draft and won't deviate too much.
Ok! Many thanks! I'll send these on and hopefully we can lock one in. So of these  which ones can be foileD?
"Unfortuantely  her fiance isn't keen on the blush. ;( I had made the draft design that colour based on your blush paper actually! I'll find an example of the sand colour for you."
No worries! I'll do that. Thanks Jamie!

"Hi   

My wife and I eloped this past week.  I searched around on your website but didn't find anything that would help us.  We would like to send out announcements with a picture from our elopement and invitations for the reception/party we are hosting.  We want to make it very clear that we are already married and that this is to celebrate the marriage to avoid any confusion that there will be any ceremony.  Are there any good options for this?"
Last question  there is no way to ship directly from you all to our guest list is there?
Thanks Jamie!  Are there any templates for elopement announcement/invitations?
Ok  that's still very helpful
You too!
I was linked to your website from WithJoy and was hoping there was some connectivity between the two
Ok.  This has been so helpful!  Thank you so much Jamie
This is great.  If all of the addresses are in the U.S.  is this still possible?
What are your shipping times now given the supplier constraints mentioned on your website?  I would like delivery to Canada.
So Paperlust Matte 300gsm is not affected?
No that's it.  I appreciate the information.  Goodbye.

Okay perfect  thanks so much Jamie
That would be great  thanks Jamie
Hi I am wanting a seating chart to go with the Melaleuca stationary. I am also wanting it to reflect three long tables. So I am wanting the name so be on either side of a line (which will signify the table). Hope this makes sense
Not in excel I have them in PDF
My friend Stevie-lee will pick them up and I will have to drop off the blank ones you gave me at a later date. Is that okay ?
Perfect thanks guys!
"Hi Jamie I am just following up on the place cards and if they will be ready by 2pm
Thanks Zoe"
Thank you so much ðŸ˜Š
hello
If we order one set of save the date  would we get a discount for the total
we want to get printed some invitations in Spanish and some in English
ahhh...well I guess they will be just 2 type cards: the invitation (80) plus the save the date (40)
yes  i have a couple more
I want to confirm a couple of things
great
What is  foil print type?
I am guessing the foil printing will be more expensive than the standard printing?
want to know if the price for each is 3.35 per card or if they will be considered two different designs
in case people have their printers?
total is around 80
do you guys sell the artwork
you too.
Thanks for your time.  I will discuss this with my husband to be.
is this a different design?
Ok.  Thanks
